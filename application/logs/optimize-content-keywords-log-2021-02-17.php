page_content = Invoice Processing Steps – Guide to Efficient Invoice Management Efficient invoice processing ensures organizations are immediately alerted with each incoming bill for quick turnaround, approval, and payments to keep good standing with suppliers. Introduction The accounting department handles cash flow by orchestrating sales, bills, and invoice payments. If these operations aren't balanced, managers can't accurately gauge the company's financial performance and overall health. Therefore, accounts payable and receivable need to establish an efficient billing system that manages financial documents in real-time. Invoice processing is a structure that organizes incoming bills and the approval process to companies can avoid late fees, credit deductions, and other penalties. Without an adequate system, businesses run the risk of missing payments, ruining their credit, and even jeopardizing their supplier relationships. Businesses should consider how invoice processing can improve their financial operations and health.

page_content = Invoice Processing Steps – Guide to Efficient Invoice Management invoice processing invoice processing Efficient invoice processing ensures organizations are immediately alerted with each incoming bill for quick turnaround, approval, and payments to keep good standing with suppliers. Invoice processing The accounting department handles cash flow by orchestrating sales, bills, and invoice payments. If these operations aren't balanced, managers can't accurately gauge the company's financial performance and overall health. Therefore, accounts payable and receivable need to establish an efficient billing system that manages financial documents in real-time. Invoice processing is a structure that organizes incoming bills and the approval process to companies can avoid late fees, credit deductions, and other penalties. Without an adequate system, businesses run the risk of missing payments, ruining their credit, and even jeopardizing their supplier relationships. Businesses should consider how invoice processing can improve their financial operations and health.

page_content = Invoice Processing Steps – Guide to Efficient Invoice Management invoice processing invoice processing Efficient invoice processing ensures organizations are immediately alerted with each incoming bill for quick turnaround, approval, and payments to keep good standing with suppliers. What is Invoice Processing? Steps to Invoice Processing 1. Receive the Invoice 2. Record the Invoice Data 3. Send Invoice for Approval 4. Pay the Invoice How to Calculate Invoice Prices 1. Outline the Process 2. Identify Involved Parties 3. Estimate Time Spent 4. Calculate Hourly Wage 5. Complete Final Calculation Reasons to Automate Invoice Processing Minimize Human Error Save Money Reduce Unnecessary Costs Integrate Systems Protect the Company from Fraud Make Report Generation Simple Tips for Invoice Management Automate the Billing Process Create Invoice Checklists Establish Invoice Timing Double Check Payment Terms Monitor Accounts Payable Efficiency The accounting department handles cash flow by orchestrating sales, bills, and invoice payments. If these operations aren't balanced, managers can't accurately gauge the company's financial performance and overall health. Therefore, accounts payable and receivable need to establish an efficient billing system that manages financial documents in real-time. Invoice processing is a structure that organizes incoming bills and the approval process to companies can avoid late fees, credit deductions, and other penalties. Without an adequate system, businesses run the risk of missing payments, ruining their credit, and even jeopardizing their supplier relationships. Businesses should consider how invoice processing can improve their financial operations and health. Invoice processing is how companies handle supplier invoices, from arrival to final payment. This process begins when the business receives their invoice, whether paper, PDF, or digital, and managers cross-examine it with the initial purchase order and payment term agreement. If everything matches, payments are made on-time and in the right measures. The invoice process is critical for maintaining cash flow and balanced accounts throughout the organization. When done accurately, invoicing limits the business’s exposure to external risks, such as fraud and theft. It also ensures all payments are made on time to avoid late fees. Invoice processing is handled entirely by the accounts payable (AP) department and consists of four steps. The process starts when AP receives an invoice from one of their suppliers after they've already fulfilled their duty. The invoice should include- The date the supplier sent the bill Contact information for both the supplier and purchaser Purchase details, including the products, services, and prices Payment details All of this information must be present so employees can match it with their previous purchase order to ensure they aren’t being overcharged. If the details do not match, managers should contact the vendor to resolve any discrepancies. These details are verified and entered into the billing system, either manually by an AP clerk or electronically through software. However, manual data entries often lead to mistakes, such as mistypes. This method is also inefficient, requiring more labor and resources, which increases expenses. In addition to storing the invoice, businesses should also make a copy or digital version of the bill to secure a backup. Invoice copies come in handy if vendors discover discrepancies or try to ask for more money. However, companies must establish an organized filing system that doesn’t take up too much room and makes it easy to locate invoices. It is important to maintain the invoice recording system as it can quickly become cluttered without continuous management. Once the invoice is checked and logged, AP needs to send the bill for final approval before they can submit the payment. Depending on the size of the business, there may be two or three executives that have the power to approve and deny invoices. The biggest determinant of the approval process’s speed is the medium in which it travels. Traditionally, invoices are printed and placed on the executive's desk, waiting for approval. This tends to elongate the process as employees can lose or forget about the invoice, often resulting in late payments and penalties. Other companies send their invoices as a PDF over email. But again, these emails can be overlooked, deleted, and forgotten. Both of these methods require AP representatives to continuously check in with executives to see if the invoice is ready, wasting valuable time. On the other hand, billing software alerts executives of new invoices through a universal interface to ensure they receive them immediately. If it is not handled promptly, the system sends regular alerts until the approval process is completed. Once the invoice is approved or denied, it is automatically sent back to AP, where they can begin processing the payment. Regardless of the approval process method, businesses should strive to reduce the wait time so they can minimize payment turnaround times and get a more accurate picture of profits. The last step of the invoice process is to submit the payment. This can look different for separate invoices, as compensation may be sent to a specific person or another company's department. Depending on the recipient, the payment process can also extend over days or even weeks. The billing system also plays a large part in the payment acceptance duration, for email confirmations can get lost or disregarded. Therefore, AP should speak directly with the recipient to ensure they understand how and when they can expect to receive their payment. Studies show that the average paper invoice costs around $15. However, this can vary significantly depending on the company’s size and resources. Therefore, businesses need to carefully calculate their invoice expense by dividing the AP annual cost by the total number of invoices processed. Mapping out the invoice process is challenging because it looks different for every business. Workers need to take their time and identify every- Challenge Obstacle Inefficiency By following the entire process from beginning to end, AP can determine the most time-consuming and expensive steps. The number of employees involved in invoice processing also impacts pricing as the business must supplement the labor. It is vital to remember workers outside of the AP department, including workers that handle the code, administrative work, and the approval process. Larger companies may even evolve multiple departments, so they must be extra careful when mapping out their process to ensure everyone is accounted for. Now that all of the involved employees are identified, managers need to determine how long each of them spend on invoice processing. Management should ask each party what task they handle and approximately how long it takes them to complete it. When the total time spent is calculated, managers need to break down each participant’s hourly wage to determine how much labor expense the process requires. If certain tasks are quick, managers may need to break down the cost per minute. Finally, management needs to multiply the time spent by each worker's hourly wage to determine the final cost per invoice. Businesses that still use manual invoice processing methods should consider how switching to automation tools can improve their overall performance. Emails, spreadsheets, and pen and paper no longer suffice when it comes to invoice processing as it increases the risk of human error. With each data entry, employees must double-check their handwriting and calculations to avoid discrepancies, wasting valuable time. On the other hand, invoice software automates recording, filing, and reporting, minimizing the risk of human error. Therefore, when AP receives an invoice, they can make a digital copy, if not already done so, and upload it to the software database. This allows employees to search the system using keywords such as the vendor, price, and product order for easy retrieval. With the various software options on today’s market, even small businesses can afford management systems. While the initial purchase may be pricey, the eventual return on investment (ROI) outweighs the solution's cost. Especially since automation tools ensure invoices are paid on time so companies can avoid late fees. This ensures the business stays in good standing with their suppliers and maintains excellent credit. Some vendors even offer additional discounts to organizations that always pay on time to incentivize reliability. By automating repetitive tasks, such as filing, record retrieval, and other clerical work, companies can save money on labor. Software also eliminates paperwork, reducing waste and money spent on office supplies. Studies show that paper invoices cost between $12-$30, whereas automated invoices can cost as low as $3.50. While most of this expense stems from labor and paper, businesses also must supplement the storage. Not to mention if the physical invoice is lost, AP must repeat the entire process, doubling the expense. Invoice software also double-checks data entries and automates calculations, preventing costly discrepancies. Advanced invoice software can integrate with existing systems to create a universal interface where employees can access all data. For example, AP can combine their billing, inventory ordering, and accounting software with their invoice solution, so data is automatically exchanged between the systems. This saves an employee from having to manually consolidate and share information. Unfortunately, many businesses fall victim to invoice fraud, where someone poses as a supplier to receive funds. Even large corporations, such as Google and Facebook, have experienced invoice fraud, costing them over $100 million. Although these organizations were stable enough to survive these hits, not every business can afford such casualties. Invoice fraud can happen in numerous ways- Fake invoices Duplicate invoices sent from suppliers Forged signatures However, with software, every invoice is verified and only sent to authorized employees. The system automatically alerts users when suspicious activity is detected. Reporting and analysis is a critical step in every business operation, from inventory management to accounting. Without software, this can take up extensive labor, brainpower, and resources. With advanced solutions, businesses can easily generate invoice reports that analyze- Invoice data Invoice calculations Order receipts Purchase orders Price trends With system integration, the software pulls these details from all relevant solutions so that employees can generate reports with a simple click. Detailed reports provide valuable insights into how businesses can improve various operations. Cash flow is especially important for small businesses, as they need to preserve as much capital as necessary to maintain stability. Slow invoice payments can significantly impact budgeting and other financial planning. Therefore, companies need to establish an effective invoice process that ensures timely, accurate payment. Many small businesses believe that automated billing solutions are for larger companies, when in fact, they are affordable and easy to navigate. With paper invoices, organizations always risk losing it, making a mistake, and even fraud. Not to mention, traditional invoices are time-consuming, require several employees, and hard to track. On the other hand, billing software digitally stores and transfers invoices to ensure they are received in a timely manner. Advanced solutions even double-check data to detect mistakes in real-time, preventing duplicate bills, miscalculations, and missed payments. Businesses that have invoice software are prompted to enter critical information to classify the bill- Customer Invoice number Date Payment agreement (payment date, incremental payments) Sales representative Product order Many large projects are paid on an incremental basis rather than in full to maintain their cash flow. This can be done weekly, monthly, and even quarterly. However, these payment plans can become hard to manage with multiple projects on different schedules. Therefore, businesses need to establish a billing schedule to promptly respond to invoices and manage suppliers’ expectations. Many late payments are due to confusion regarding the billing schedule. To prevent penalties, companies should check payment terms and ensure all parties have reasonable expectations. After the invoicing process is implemented, AP needs to monitor the system to ensure it records and files bills efficiently. An efficient system sends invoices immediately after a sale, triggers the approval process, and reviews agreement terms regularly.

If these operations aren't balanced, managers can't accurately gauge the company's financial performance and overall health. Therefore, accounts payable and receivable need to establish an efficient billing system that manages financial documents in real-time. Invoice processing is a structure that organizes incoming bills and the approval process to companies can avoid late fees, credit deductions, and other penalties. Without an adequate system, businesses run the risk of missing payments, ruining their credit, and even jeopardizing their supplier relationships. Businesses should consider how invoice processing can improve their financial operations and health. Invoice processing is how companies handle supplier invoices, from arrival to final payment. This process begins when the business receives their invoice, whether paper, PDF, or digital, and managers cross-examine it with the initial purchase order and payment term agreement. If everything matches, payments are made on-time and in the right measures. The invoice process is critical for maintaining cash flow and balanced accounts throughout the organization. When done accurately, invoicing limits the business's exposure to external risks, such as fraud and theft. It also ensures all payments are made on time to avoid late fees. Invoice processing is handled entirely by the accounts payable (AP) department and consists of four steps. The process starts when AP receives an invoice from one of their suppliers after they've already fulfilled their duty. The invoice should include- The date the supplier sent the bill Contact information for both the supplier and purchaser Purchase details, including the products, services, and prices Payment details All of this information must be present so employees can match it with their previous purchase order to ensure they aren't being overcharged. If the details do not match, managers should contact the vendor to resolve any discrepancies. These details are verified and entered into the billing system, either manually by an AP clerk or electronically through software. However, manual data entries often lead to mistakes, such as mistypes. This method is also inefficient, requiring more labor and resources, which increases expenses. In addition to storing the invoice, businesses should also make a copy or digital version of the bill to secure a backup. Invoice copies come in handy if vendors discover discrepancies or try to ask for more money. However, companies must establish an organized filing system that doesn't take up too much room and makes it easy to locate invoices. It is important to maintain the invoice recording system as it can quickly become cluttered without continuous management. Once the invoice is checked and logged, AP needs to send the bill for final approval before they can submit the payment. Depending on the size of the business, there may be two or three executives that have the power to approve and deny invoices. The biggest determinant of the approval process's speed is the medium in which it travels. Traditionally, invoices are printed and placed on the executive's desk, waiting for approval. This tends to elongate the process as employees can lose or forget about the invoice, often resulting in late payments and penalties. Other companies send their invoices as a PDF over email. But again, these emails can be overlooked, deleted, and forgotten. Both of these methods require AP representatives to continuously check in with executives to see if the invoice is ready, wasting valuable time. On the other hand, billing software alerts executives of new invoices through a universal interface to ensure they receive them immediately. If it is not handled promptly, the system sends regular alerts until the approval process is completed. Once the invoice is approved or denied, it is automatically sent back to AP, where they can begin processing the payment. Regardless of the approval process method, businesses should strive to reduce the wait time so they can minimize payment turnaround times and get a more accurate picture of profits. The last step of the invoice process is to submit the payment. This can look different for separate invoices, as compensation may be sent to a specific person or another company's department. Depending on the recipient, the payment process can also extend over days or even weeks. The billing system also plays a large part in the payment acceptance duration, for email confirmations can get lost or disregarded. Therefore, AP should speak directly with the recipient to ensure they understand how and when they can expect to receive their payment. Studies show that the average paper invoice costs around $15. However, this can vary significantly depending on the company's size and resources. Therefore, businesses need to carefully calculate their invoice expense by dividing the AP annual cost by the total number of invoices processed. Mapping out the invoice process is challenging because it looks different for every business. Workers need to take their time and identify every- Challenge Obstacle Inefficiency By following the entire process from beginning to end, AP can determine the most time-consuming and expensive steps. The number of employees involved in invoice processing also impacts pricing as the business must supplement the labor. It is vital to remember workers outside of the AP department, including workers that handle the code, administrative work, and the approval process. Larger companies may even evolve multiple departments, so they must be extra careful when mapping out their process to ensure everyone is accounted for. Now that all of the involved employees are identified, managers need to determine how long each of them spend on invoice processing. Management should ask each party what task they handle and approximately how long it takes them to complete it. When the total time spent is calculated, managers need to break down each participant's hourly wage to determine how much labor expense the process requires. If certain tasks are quick, managers may need to break down the cost per minute. Finally, management needs to multiply the time spent by each worker's hourly wage to determine the final cost per invoice. Businesses that still use manual invoice processing methods should consider how switching to automation tools can improve their overall performance. Emails, spreadsheets, and pen and paper no longer suffice when it comes to invoice processing as it increases the risk of human error. With each data entry, employees must double-check their handwriting and calculations to avoid discrepancies, wasting valuable time. On the other hand, invoice software automates recording, filing, and reporting, minimizing the risk of human error. Therefore, when AP receives an invoice, they can make a digital copy, if not already done so, and upload it to the software database. This allows employees to search the system using keywords such as the vendor, price, and product order for easy retrieval. With the various software options on today's market, even small businesses can afford management systems. While the initial purchase may be pricey, the eventual return on investment (ROI) outweighs the solution's cost. Especially since automation tools ensure invoices are paid on time so companies can avoid late fees. This ensures the business stays in good standing with their suppliers and maintains excellent credit. Some vendors even offer additional discounts to organizations that always pay on time to incentivize reliability. By automating repetitive tasks, such as filing, record retrieval, and other clerical work, companies can save money on labor. Software also eliminates paperwork, reducing waste and money spent on office supplies. Studies show that paper invoices cost between $12-$30, whereas automated invoices can cost as low as $3.50. While most of this expense stems from labor and paper, businesses also must supplement the storage. Not to mention if the physical invoice is lost, AP must repeat the entire process, doubling the expense. Invoice software also double-checks data entries and automates calculations, preventing costly discrepancies. Advanced invoice software can integrate with existing systems to create a universal interface where employees can access all data. For example, AP can combine their billing, inventory ordering, and accounting software with their invoice solution, so data is automatically exchanged between the systems. This saves an employee from having to manually consolidate and share information. Unfortunately, many businesses fall victim to invoice fraud, where someone poses as a supplier to receive funds. Even large corporations, such as Google and Facebook, have experienced invoice fraud, costing them over $100 million. Although these organizations were stable enough to survive these hits, not every business can afford such casualties. Invoice fraud can happen in numerous ways- Fake invoices Duplicate invoices sent from suppliers Forged signatures However, with software, every invoice is verified and only sent to authorized employees. The system automatically alerts users when suspicious activity is detected. Reporting and analysis is a critical step in every business operation, from inventory management to accounting. Without software, this can take up extensive labor, brainpower, and resources. With advanced solutions, businesses can easily generate invoice reports that analyze- Invoice data Invoice calculations Order receipts Purchase orders Price trends With system integration, the software pulls these details from all relevant solutions so that employees can generate reports with a simple click. Detailed reports provide valuable insights into how businesses can improve various operations. Cash flow is especially important for small businesses, as they need to preserve as much capital as necessary to maintain stability. Slow invoice payments can significantly impact budgeting and other financial planning. Therefore, companies need to establish an effective invoice process that ensures timely, accurate payment. Many small businesses believe that automated billing solutions are for larger companies, when in fact, they are affordable and easy to navigate. With paper invoices, organizations always risk losing it, making a mistake, and even fraud. Not to mention, traditional invoices are time-consuming, require several employees, and hard to track. On the other hand, billing software digitally stores and transfers invoices to ensure they are received in a timely manner. Advanced solutions even double-check data to detect mistakes in real-time, preventing duplicate bills, miscalculations, and missed payments. Businesses that have invoice software are prompted to enter critical information to classify the bill- Customer Invoice number Date Payment agreement (payment date, incremental payments) Sales representative Product order Many large projects are paid on an incremental basis rather than in full to maintain their cash flow. This can be done weekly, monthly, and even quarterly. However, these payment plans can become hard to manage with multiple projects on different schedules. Therefore, businesses need to establish a billing schedule to promptly respond to invoices and manage suppliers' expectations. Many late payments are due to confusion regarding the billing schedule. To prevent penalties, companies should check payment terms and ensure all parties have reasonable expectations. After the invoicing process is implemented, AP needs to monitor the system to ensure it records and files bills efficiently. An efficient system sends invoices immediately after a sale, triggers the approval process, and reviews agreement terms regularly.

If these operations aren't balanced, managers can't accurately gauge the company's financial performance and overall health. Therefore, accounts payable and receivable need to establish an efficient billing system that manages financial documents in real-time. Invoice processing is a structure that organizes incoming bills and the approval process to companies can avoid late fees, credit deductions, and other penalties. Without an adequate system, businesses run the risk of missing payments, ruining their credit, and even jeopardizing their supplier relationships. Businesses should consider how invoice processing can improve their financial operations and health. Invoice processing is how companies handle supplier invoices, from arrival to final payment. This process begins when the business receives their invoice, whether paper, PDF, or digital, and managers cross-examine it with the initial purchase order and payment term agreement. If everything matches, payments are made on-time and in the right measures. The invoice process is critical for maintaining cash flow and balanced accounts throughout the organization. When done accurately, invoicing limits the business's exposure to external risks, such as fraud and theft. It also ensures all payments are made on time to avoid late fees. Invoice processing is handled entirely by the accounts payable (AP) department and consists of four steps. The process starts when AP receives an invoice from one of their suppliers after they've already fulfilled their duty. The invoice should include- The date the supplier sent the bill Contact information for both the supplier and purchaser Purchase details, including the products, services, and prices Payment details All of this information must be present so employees can match it with their previous purchase order to ensure they aren't being overcharged. If the details do not match, managers should contact the vendor to resolve any discrepancies. These details are verified and entered into the billing system, either manually by an AP clerk or electronically through software. However, manual data entries often lead to mistakes, such as mistypes. This method is also inefficient, requiring more labor and resources, which increases expenses. In addition to storing the invoice, businesses should also make a copy or digital version of the bill to secure a backup. Invoice copies come in handy if vendors discover discrepancies or try to ask for more money. However, companies must establish an organized filing system that doesn't take up too much room and makes it easy to locate invoices. It is important to maintain the invoice recording system as it can quickly become cluttered without continuous management. Once the invoice is checked and logged, AP needs to send the bill for final approval before they can submit the payment. Depending on the size of the business, there may be two or three executives that have the power to approve and deny invoices. The biggest determinant of the approval process's speed is the medium in which it travels. Traditionally, invoices are printed and placed on the executive's desk, waiting for approval. This tends to elongate the process as employees can lose or forget about the invoice, often resulting in late payments and penalties. Other companies send their invoices as a PDF over email. But again, these emails can be overlooked, deleted, and forgotten. Both of these methods require AP representatives to continuously check in with executives to see if the invoice is ready, wasting valuable time. On the other hand, billing software alerts executives of new invoices through a universal interface to ensure they receive them immediately. If it is not handled promptly, the system sends regular alerts until the approval process is completed. Once the invoice is approved or denied, it is automatically sent back to AP, where they can begin processing the payment. Regardless of the approval process method, businesses should strive to reduce the wait time so they can minimize payment turnaround times and get a more accurate picture of profits. The last step of the invoice process is to submit the payment. This can look different for separate invoices, as compensation may be sent to a specific person or another company's department. Depending on the recipient, the payment process can also extend over days or even weeks. The billing system also plays a large part in the payment acceptance duration, for email confirmations can get lost or disregarded. Therefore, AP should speak directly with the recipient to ensure they understand how and when they can expect to receive their payment. Studies show that the average paper invoice costs around $15. However, this can vary significantly depending on the company's size and resources. Therefore, businesses need to carefully calculate their invoice expense by dividing the AP annual cost by the total number of invoices processed. Mapping out the invoice process is challenging because it looks different for every business. Workers need to take their time and identify every- Challenge Obstacle Inefficiency By following the entire process from beginning to end, AP can determine the most time-consuming and expensive steps. The number of employees involved in invoice processing also impacts pricing as the business must supplement the labor. It is vital to remember workers outside of the AP department, including workers that handle the code, administrative work, and the approval process. Larger companies may even evolve multiple departments, so they must be extra careful when mapping out their process to ensure everyone is accounted for. Now that all of the involved employees are identified, managers need to determine how long each of them spend on invoice processing. Management should ask each party what task they handle and approximately how long it takes them to complete it. When the total time spent is calculated, managers need to break down each participant's hourly wage to determine how much labor expense the process requires. If certain tasks are quick, managers may need to break down the cost per minute. Finally, management needs to multiply the time spent by each worker's hourly wage to determine the final cost per invoice. Businesses that still use manual invoice processing methods should consider how switching to automation tools can improve their overall performance. Emails, spreadsheets, and pen and paper no longer suffice when it comes to invoice processing as it increases the risk of human error. With each data entry, employees must double-check their handwriting and calculations to avoid discrepancies, wasting valuable time. On the other hand, invoice software automates recording, filing, and reporting, minimizing the risk of human error. Therefore, when AP receives an invoice, they can make a digital copy, if not already done so, and upload it to the software database. This allows employees to search the system using keywords such as the vendor, price, and product order for easy retrieval. With the various software options on today's market, even small businesses can afford management systems. While the initial purchase may be pricey, the eventual return on investment (ROI) outweighs the solution's cost. Especially since automation tools ensure invoices are paid on time so companies can avoid late fees. This ensures the business stays in good standing with their suppliers and maintains excellent credit. Some vendors even offer additional discounts to organizations that always pay on time to incentivize reliability. By automating repetitive tasks, such as filing, record retrieval, and other clerical work, companies can save money on labor. Software also eliminates paperwork, reducing waste and money spent on office supplies. Studies show that paper invoices cost between $12-$30, whereas automated invoices can cost as low as $3.50. While most of this expense stems from labor and paper, businesses also must supplement the storage. Not to mention if the physical invoice is lost, AP must repeat the entire process, doubling the expense. Invoice software also double-checks data entries and automates calculations, preventing costly discrepancies. Advanced invoice software can integrate with existing systems to create a universal interface where employees can access all data. For example, AP can combine their billing, inventory ordering, and accounting software with their invoice solution, so data is automatically exchanged between the systems. This saves an employee from having to manually consolidate and share information. Unfortunately, many businesses fall victim to invoice fraud, where someone poses as a supplier to receive funds. Even large corporations, such as Google and Facebook, have experienced invoice fraud, costing them over $100 million. Although these organizations were stable enough to survive these hits, not every business can afford such casualties. Invoice fraud can happen in numerous ways- Fake invoices Duplicate invoices sent from suppliers Forged signatures However, with software, every invoice is verified and only sent to authorized employees. The system automatically alerts users when suspicious activity is detected. Reporting and analysis is a critical step in every business operation, from inventory management to accounting. Without software, this can take up extensive labor, brainpower, and resources. With advanced solutions, businesses can easily generate invoice reports that analyze- Invoice data Invoice calculations Order receipts Purchase orders Price trends With system integration, the software pulls these details from all relevant solutions so that employees can generate reports with a simple click. Detailed reports provide valuable insights into how businesses can improve various operations. Cash flow is especially important for small businesses, as they need to preserve as much capital as necessary to maintain stability. Slow invoice payments can significantly impact budgeting and other financial planning. Therefore, companies need to establish an effective invoice process that ensures timely, accurate payment. Many small businesses believe that automated billing solutions are for larger companies, when in fact, they are affordable and easy to navigate. With paper invoices, organizations always risk losing it, making a mistake, and even fraud. Not to mention, traditional invoices are time-consuming, require several employees, and hard to track. On the other hand, billing software digitally stores and transfers invoices to ensure they are received in a timely manner. Advanced solutions even double-check data to detect mistakes in real-time, preventing duplicate bills, miscalculations, and missed payments. Businesses that have invoice software are prompted to enter critical information to classify the bill- Customer Invoice number Date Payment agreement (payment date, incremental payments) Sales representative Product order Many large projects are paid on an incremental basis rather than in full to maintain their cash flow. This can be done weekly, monthly, and even quarterly. However, these payment plans can become hard to manage with multiple projects on different schedules. Therefore, businesses need to establish a billing schedule to promptly respond to invoices and manage suppliers' expectations. Many late payments are due to confusion regarding the billing schedule. To prevent penalties, companies should check payment terms and ensure all parties have reasonable expectations. After the invoicing process is implemented, AP needs to monitor the system to ensure it records and files bills efficiently. An efficient system sends invoices immediately after a sale, triggers the approval process, and reviews agreement terms regularly.

page_content = 8 Easy Steps to Building Out a Strategic Business Plan Strategic business plan There are 8 steps available to help business professionals with their strategic business plan process. 8 Steps to Developing a Strategic Business Plan 1. Statement Reflection Tip: 2. SWOT Analysis 3. Objective Establishment 4. Staffing Determination 5. Resource Determination 6. Strategy Thinktank 7. Plan Composition 8. Plan Measurement Note: Although the two terms are oftentimes used interchangeably, a business plan and a strategic business plan are not the same. A business plan usually sets short term goals and details the steps necessary to accomplish them. Alternatively, a strategic plan typically sets mid to long term goals and details the strategies required to achieve them. A commonly accepted definition of a strategic business plan is a written document that combines company objectives with market place needs. Business plan components like the executive summary and marketing plan analysis are included within a strategic business plan. However, a strategic business plan will go a step further than a traditional business plan by specifically indicating how a company will achieve established goals. A significant differentiator between a business plan and a strategic plan is the utilization of established mid to long term goals in order to take advantage of any business opportunities available. Another significant business plan and strategic plan differentiator is the extensive analysis undertaken. Analysis during strategic business planning studies both the larger business environment and specific company strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The dissection of a specific organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats is commonly abbreviated as the SWOT analysis process. A strategic business plan is a powerful tool for both larger market share and competitive advantage obtainment. The strategic plan influences virtually everything within a business, from customer service processes to marketing plan initiatives. As such, both small businesses and larger corporations must make sure that their strategic business plan is optimal. 8 steps to develop a strategic business plan include: During strategic business planning iniatives staff members must make sure that their mission statement and vision statement are reevaluated. The mission statement will help business professionals remember the specific core competencies their organization possesses. The vision statement will help business professionals create goals. Team members must make sure to incorporate both the mission statement and vision statement into the strategic business plan. Extensive analysis is beneficial for strategic business planning efforts. A SWOT analysis identifies strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Professionals must make sure to consider both external factors and internal factors during the strategic business planning process. Business goals that fit the SMART goals model are ideal for strategic business planning. The SMART goals acronym stands for specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. Both SWOT analysis and SMART goal development are immensely helpful tools for strategic business planning efforts. Proper business planning requires strategic workforce planning. There are several different considerations that business professionals must make sure to evaluate throughout strategic workforce planning processes. One important consideration is deciding if human resources needs to recruit new staff members. Another consideration is determining which specific departments need additional staff. With more remote workers than ever before, many human resources departments are expanding their talent pool to include both independent contractors and virtual workers.Strategic business planning must take into consideration available resources beyond staffing requirements. Determining resource availability will help business professionals avoid unnecessary strategic business plan complications. For example, a small business may determine that they do not have the necessary resources required to accomplish their strategic business plan but that next year or five years down the line they can reevaluate.Strategic business planning decision making discussions should include more than just a business owner and high level executives. Inviting team members from throughout the organization optimizes decision making capabilities. Of course, not every employee on staff needs to be invited to decision making discussions. However, staff members that have demonstrated excellent decision making skills in the past may help business planning initiatives significantly.Composing an action plan is an important part of the business planning process. The project leader should be included while action plan composition is occurring. A small business may assign the project leader role to a business owner or high level executive. A larger corporation will likely assign the project leader role to a high level internal executive or a third party consultant. The project leader must make sure that the action plan sets the strategic business plan up for success. Consistently measuring strategic business plan success will help business professionals identify any issues. By identifying issues earlier on, corrective action can be taken more quickly and a lot of serious long term damage may be averted. Measurements should incorporate a variety of key performance indicators and data analysis. The insights gained from strategic business plan measurement will help business professionals in the future when they are building out the next plan. From key performance indicators to more complex data analysis, strategic business plan measurement will help business professionals make sure the plan stays on track.

If these operations aren't balanced, managers can't accurately gauge the company's financial performance and overall health. Therefore, accounts payable and receivable need to establish an efficient billing system that manages financial documents in real-time. Invoice processing is a structure that organizes incoming bills and the approval process to companies can avoid late fees, credit deductions, and other penalties. Without an adequate system, businesses run the risk of missing payments, ruining their credit, and even jeopardizing their supplier relationships. Businesses should consider how invoice processing can improve their financial operations and health. Invoice processing is how companies handle supplier invoices, from arrival to final payment. This process begins when the business receives their invoice, whether paper, PDF, or digital, and managers cross-examine it with the initial purchase order and payment term agreement. If everything matches, payments are made on-time and in the right measures. The invoice process is critical for maintaining cash flow and balanced accounts throughout the organization. When done accurately, invoicing limits the business's exposure to external risks, such as fraud and theft. It also ensures all payments are made on time to avoid late fees. Invoice processing is handled entirely by the accounts payable (AP) department and consists of four steps. The process starts when AP receives an invoice from one of their suppliers after they've already fulfilled their duty. The invoice should include- The date the supplier sent the bill Contact information for both the supplier and purchaser Purchase details, including the products, services, and prices Payment details All of this information must be present so employees can match it with their previous purchase order to ensure they aren't being overcharged. If the details do not match, managers should contact the vendor to resolve any discrepancies. These details are verified and entered into the billing system, either manually by an AP clerk or electronically through software. However, manual data entries often lead to mistakes, such as mistypes. This method is also inefficient, requiring more labor and resources, which increases expenses. In addition to storing the invoice, businesses should also make a copy or digital version of the bill to secure a backup. Invoice copies come in handy if vendors discover discrepancies or try to ask for more money. However, companies must establish an organized filing system that doesn't take up too much room and makes it easy to locate invoices. It is important to maintain the invoice recording system as it can quickly become cluttered without continuous management. Once the invoice is checked and logged, AP needs to send the bill for final approval before they can submit the payment. Depending on the size of the business, there may be two or three executives that have the power to approve and deny invoices. The biggest determinant of the approval process's speed is the medium in which it travels. Traditionally, invoices are printed and placed on the executive's desk, waiting for approval. This tends to elongate the process as employees can lose or forget about the invoice, often resulting in late payments and penalties. Other companies send their invoices as a PDF over email. But again, these emails can be overlooked, deleted, and forgotten. Both of these methods require AP representatives to continuously check in with executives to see if the invoice is ready, wasting valuable time. On the other hand, billing software alerts executives of new invoices through a universal interface to ensure they receive them immediately. If it is not handled promptly, the system sends regular alerts until the approval process is completed. Once the invoice is approved or denied, it is automatically sent back to AP, where they can begin processing the payment. Regardless of the approval process method, businesses should strive to reduce the wait time so they can minimize payment turnaround times and get a more accurate picture of profits. The last step of the invoice process is to submit the payment. This can look different for separate invoices, as compensation may be sent to a specific person or another company's department. Depending on the recipient, the payment process can also extend over days or even weeks. The billing system also plays a large part in the payment acceptance duration, for email confirmations can get lost or disregarded. Therefore, AP should speak directly with the recipient to ensure they understand how and when they can expect to receive their payment. Studies show that the average paper invoice costs around $15. However, this can vary significantly depending on the company's size and resources. Therefore, businesses need to carefully calculate their invoice expense by dividing the AP annual cost by the total number of invoices processed. Mapping out the invoice process is challenging because it looks different for every business. Workers need to take their time and identify every- Challenge Obstacle Inefficiency By following the entire process from beginning to end, AP can determine the most time-consuming and expensive steps. The number of employees involved in invoice processing also impacts pricing as the business must supplement the labor. It is vital to remember workers outside of the AP department, including workers that handle the code, administrative work, and the approval process. Larger companies may even evolve multiple departments, so they must be extra careful when mapping out their process to ensure everyone is accounted for. Now that all of the involved employees are identified, managers need to determine how long each of them spend on invoice processing. Management should ask each party what task they handle and approximately how long it takes them to complete it. When the total time spent is calculated, managers need to break down each participant's hourly wage to determine how much labor expense the process requires. If certain tasks are quick, managers may need to break down the cost per minute. Finally, management needs to multiply the time spent by each worker's hourly wage to determine the final cost per invoice. Businesses that still use manual invoice processing methods should consider how switching to automation tools can improve their overall performance. Emails, spreadsheets, and pen and paper no longer suffice when it comes to invoice processing as it increases the risk of human error. With each data entry, employees must double-check their handwriting and calculations to avoid discrepancies, wasting valuable time. On the other hand, invoice software automates recording, filing, and reporting, minimizing the risk of human error. Therefore, when AP receives an invoice, they can make a digital copy, if not already done so, and upload it to the software database. This allows employees to search the system using keywords such as the vendor, price, and product order for easy retrieval. With the various software options on today's market, even small businesses can afford management systems. While the initial purchase may be pricey, the eventual return on investment (ROI) outweighs the solution's cost. Especially since automation tools ensure invoices are paid on time so companies can avoid late fees. This ensures the business stays in good standing with their suppliers and maintains excellent credit. Some vendors even offer additional discounts to organizations that always pay on time to incentivize reliability. By automating repetitive tasks, such as filing, record retrieval, and other clerical work, companies can save money on labor. Software also eliminates paperwork, reducing waste and money spent on office supplies. Studies show that paper invoices cost between $12-$30, whereas automated invoices can cost as low as $3.50. While most of this expense stems from labor and paper, businesses also must supplement the storage. Not to mention if the physical invoice is lost, AP must repeat the entire process, doubling the expense. Invoice software also double-checks data entries and automates calculations, preventing costly discrepancies. Advanced invoice software can integrate with existing systems to create a universal interface where employees can access all data. For example, AP can combine their billing, inventory ordering, and accounting software with their invoice solution, so data is automatically exchanged between the systems. This saves an employee from having to manually consolidate and share information. Unfortunately, many businesses fall victim to invoice fraud, where someone poses as a supplier to receive funds. Even large corporations, such as Google and Facebook, have experienced invoice fraud, costing them over $100 million. Although these organizations were stable enough to survive these hits, not every business can afford such casualties. Invoice fraud can happen in numerous ways- Fake invoices Duplicate invoices sent from suppliers Forged signatures However, with software, every invoice is verified and only sent to authorized employees. The system automatically alerts users when suspicious activity is detected. Reporting and analysis is a critical step in every business operation, from inventory management to accounting. Without software, this can take up extensive labor, brainpower, and resources. With advanced solutions, businesses can easily generate invoice reports that analyze- Invoice data Invoice calculations Order receipts Purchase orders Price trends With system integration, the software pulls these details from all relevant solutions so that employees can generate reports with a simple click. Detailed reports provide valuable insights into how businesses can improve various operations. Cash flow is especially important for small businesses, as they need to preserve as much capital as necessary to maintain stability. Slow invoice payments can significantly impact budgeting and other financial planning. Therefore, companies need to establish an effective invoice process that ensures timely, accurate payment. Many small businesses believe that automated billing solutions are for larger companies, when in fact, they are affordable and easy to navigate. With paper invoices, organizations always risk losing it, making a mistake, and even fraud. Not to mention, traditional invoices are time-consuming, require several employees, and hard to track. On the other hand, billing software digitally stores and transfers invoices to ensure they are received in a timely manner. Advanced solutions even double-check data to detect mistakes in real-time, preventing duplicate bills, miscalculations, and missed payments. Businesses that have invoice software are prompted to enter critical information to classify the bill- Customer Invoice number Date Payment agreement (payment date, incremental payments) Sales representative Product order Many large projects are paid on an incremental basis rather than in full to maintain their cash flow. This can be done weekly, monthly, and even quarterly. However, these payment plans can become hard to manage with multiple projects on different schedules. Therefore, businesses need to establish a billing schedule to promptly respond to invoices and manage suppliers' expectations. Many late payments are due to confusion regarding the billing schedule. To prevent penalties, companies should check payment terms and ensure all parties have reasonable expectations. After the invoicing process is implemented, AP needs to monitor the system to ensure it records and files bills efficiently. An efficient system sends invoices immediately after a sale, triggers the approval process, and reviews agreement terms regularly.

page_content = 8 Easy Steps to Building Out a Strategic Business Plan Strategic business plan There are 8 steps available to help business professionals with their strategic business plan process. 8 Steps to Developing a Strategic Business Plan 1. Statement Reflection Tip: 2. SWOT Analysis 3. Objective Establishment 4. Staffing Determination 5. Resource Determination 6. Strategy Thinktank 7. Plan Composition 8. Plan Measurement Note: Key Takeaways Although the two terms are oftentimes used interchangeably, a business plan and a strategic business plan are not the same. A business plan usually sets short term goals and details the steps necessary to accomplish them. Alternatively, a strategic plan typically sets mid to long term goals and details the strategies required to achieve them. A commonly accepted definition of a strategic business plan is a written document that combines company objectives with market place needs. Business plan components like the executive summary and marketing plan analysis are included within a strategic business plan. However, a strategic business plan will go a step further than a traditional business plan by specifically indicating how a company will achieve established goals. A significant differentiator between a business plan and a strategic plan is the utilization of established mid to long term goals in order to take advantage of any business opportunities available. Another significant business plan and strategic plan differentiator is the extensive analysis undertaken. Analysis during strategic business planning studies both the larger business environment and specific company strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The dissection of a specific organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats is commonly abbreviated as the SWOT analysis process. A strategic business plan is a powerful tool for both larger market share and competitive advantage obtainment. The strategic plan influences virtually everything within a business, from customer service processes to marketing plan initiatives. As such, both small businesses and larger corporations must make sure that their strategic business plan is optimal. 8 steps to develop a strategic business plan include: During strategic business planning iniatives staff members must make sure that their mission statement and vision statement are reevaluated. The mission statement will help business professionals remember the specific core competencies their organization possesses. The vision statement will help business professionals create goals. Team members must make sure to incorporate both the mission statement and vision statement into the strategic business plan. Extensive analysis is beneficial for strategic business planning efforts. A SWOT analysis identifies strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Professionals must make sure to consider both external factors and internal factors during the strategic business planning process. Business goals that fit the SMART goals model are ideal for strategic business planning. The SMART goals acronym stands for specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. Both SWOT analysis and SMART goal development are immensely helpful tools for strategic business planning efforts. Proper business planning requires strategic workforce planning. There are several different considerations that business professionals must make sure to evaluate throughout strategic workforce planning processes. One important consideration is deciding if human resources needs to recruit new staff members. Another consideration is determining which specific departments need additional staff. With more remote workers than ever before, many human resources departments are expanding their talent pool to include both independent contractors and virtual workers.Strategic business planning must take into consideration available resources beyond staffing requirements. Determining resource availability will help business professionals avoid unnecessary strategic business plan complications. For example, a small business may determine that they do not have the necessary resources required to accomplish their strategic business plan but that next year or five years down the line they can reevaluate.Strategic business planning decision making discussions should include more than just a business owner and high level executives. Inviting team members from throughout the organization optimizes decision making capabilities. Of course, not every employee on staff needs to be invited to decision making discussions. However, staff members that have demonstrated excellent decision making skills in the past may help business planning initiatives significantly.Composing an action plan is an important part of the business planning process. The project leader should be included while action plan composition is occurring. A small business may assign the project leader role to a business owner or high level executive. A larger corporation will likely assign the project leader role to a high level internal executive or a third party consultant. The project leader must make sure that the action plan sets the strategic business plan up for success. Consistently measuring strategic business plan success will help business professionals identify any issues. By identifying issues earlier on, corrective action can be taken more quickly and a lot of serious long term damage may be averted. Measurements should incorporate a variety of key performance indicators and data analysis. The insights gained from strategic business plan measurement will help business professionals in the future when they are building out the next plan. From key performance indicators to more complex data analysis, strategic business plan measurement will help business professionals make sure the plan stays on track. Strategic business plans help organizations to achieve goals that are generally mid to long term. Steps for building out strategic business plans include the establishment of a strategic planning team and SWOT analysis execution.

Statement Reflection Strategic business plan Tip: 2. SWOT Analysis 3. Objective Establishment 4. Staffing Determination Strategic business plan 5. Resource Determination 6. Strategy Thinktank 7. Plan Composition Strategic business plan 8. Plan Measurement Note: Key Takeaways Although the two terms are oftentimes used interchangeably, a business plan and a strategic business plan are not the same. A business plan usually sets short term goals and details the steps necessary to accomplish them. Alternatively, a strategic plan typically sets mid to long term goals and details the strategies required to achieve them. A commonly accepted definition of a strategic business plan is a written document that combines company objectives with market place needs. Business plan components like the executive summary and marketing plan analysis are included within a strategic business plan. However, a strategic business plan will go a step further than a traditional business plan by specifically indicating how a company will achieve established goals. A significant differentiator between a business plan and a strategic plan is the utilization of established mid to long term goals in order to take advantage of any business opportunities available. Another significant business plan and strategic plan differentiator is the extensive analysis undertaken. Analysis during strategic business planning studies both the larger business environment and specific company strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The dissection of a specific organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats is commonly abbreviated as the SWOT analysis process. A strategic business plan is a powerful tool for both larger market share and competitive advantage obtainment. The strategic plan influences virtually everything within a business, from customer service processes to marketing plan initiatives. As such, both small businesses and larger corporations must make sure that their strategic business plan is optimal. 8 steps to develop a strategic business plan include:During strategic business planning initiatives, staff members must make sure that their mission statement and vision statement are reevaluated. The mission statement will help business professionals remember the specific core competencies their organization possesses. The vision statement will help business professionals create goals. Team members must make sure to incorporate both the mission statement and vision statement into the strategic business plan. Extensive analysis is beneficial for strategic business planning efforts. A SWOT analysis identifies strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Professionals must make sure to consider both external factors and internal factors during the strategic business planning process.Business goals that fit the SMART goals model are ideal for strategic business planning. The SMART goals acronym stands for specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. Both SWOT analysis and SMART goal development are immensely helpful tools for strategic business planning efforts.Proper business planning requires strategic workforce planning. There are several different considerations that business professionals must make sure to evaluate throughout strategic workforce planning processes. One important consideration is deciding if human resources need to recruit new staff members. Another consideration is determining which specific departments need additional staff. With more remote workers than ever before, many human resources departments are expanding their talent pool to include both independent contractors and virtual workers.Strategic business planning must take into consideration available resources beyond staffing requirements. Determining resource availability will help business professionals avoid unnecessary strategic business plan complications. For example, a small business may determine that they do not have the necessary resources required to accomplish their strategic business plan but that next year or five years down the line they can reevaluate.Strategic business planning decision making discussions should include more than just a business owner and high level executives. Inviting team members from throughout the organization optimizes decision making capabilities. Of course, not every employee on staff needs to be invited to decision making discussions. However, staff members that have demonstrated excellent decision making skills in the past may help business planning initiatives significantly.Composing an action plan is an important part of the business planning process. The project leader should be included while action plan composition is occurring. A small business may assign the project leader role to a business owner or high level executive. A larger corporation will likely assign the project leader role to a high level internal executive or a third party consultant. The project leader must make sure that the action plan sets the strategic business plan up for success.Consistently measuring strategic business plan success will help business professionals identify any issues. By identifying issues earlier on, corrective action can be taken more quickly and a lot of serious long term damage may be averted. Measurements should incorporate a variety of key performance indicators and data analysis. The insights gained from strategic business plan measurement will help business professionals in the future when they are building out the next plan. From key performance indicators to more complex data analysis, strategic business plan measurement will help business professionals make sure the plan stays on track. Strategic business plans help organizations to achieve goals that are generally mid to long term. Steps for building out strategic business plans include the establishment of a strategic planning team and SWOT analysis execution.

page_content = How to Lower Shipping Costs for Small Businesses – 4 Ideas Shipping costs for small businesses make up a significant proportion of order fulfillment expenses, making cost reduction practices critical for profitability. Shipping Cost Components Service and Speed Dimension and Weight Destination Shipping Volume How Small Businesses Can Reduce Shipping Costs Consider Pick-Up vs. Drop-Off Negotiate Rates Choose Affordable Packing Supplies Consider Outsourcing vs. In-House Fulfillment Many startups do not understand their options when it comes to inventory management, order fulfillment, and shipping. Depending on the company’s customer and inventory types, they may experience inflated shipping costs. Therefore, owners should understand how shipping costs for small businesses are calculated to determine what methods best suit their budget. Before companies set their shipping rates, they weigh the four primary factors of each order. While consumers have always desired fast deliveries, online retail giants, such as Amazon, have significantly raised customers’ expectations of shipment speed. As most people understand, the quicker the delivery speed, the more expensive the shipment. This means that expedited shipping is typically the most expensive option. However, the price also increases with every added service and shipping requirement, such as- Guaranteed delivery by date Tracking Insurance Specialized delivery instructions Required signature upon arrival Commercial, residential, or government building Shipping alcohol or hazardous materials Temperature-sensitive products Shipping rates also increase as the product's weight and size increase. These prices tend to vary between carrying companies based on their vehicles and space availability. The major carriers, including FedEx, USPS, and UPS, charge by a package's dimensional weight (DIM). In other words, the price of each shipment is calculated based on its size rather than weight. This means that large packages cost more to ship, even if they are lighter than a smaller, heavier parcel. To calculate DIM, businesses use a simple equation- DIM= (Length x Width x Height) / Divisor The divisor is determined by each individual carrier- UPS = 139 FedEx = 139 USPS = 166 The higher the divisor, the lower the shipping price, making USPS the most cost-efficient option when it comes to shipping larger parcels. However, most carriers offer a standardized shipping option, where shippers pay the flat rate for their package, regardless of its weight and size. USPS and UPS allow up to 70 pounds, whereas FedEx allows up to 50 pounds for their flat rate boxes. There is also cubic pricing, which is used to ship small, dense packages. The cubic pricing for Items under 20 pounds is calculated by- Cubic Feet = (Length x Width x Height) / 1728 The end value is then categorized into one of five groups that range from .1 to .5 cubic feet. The further the carrier has to travel to deliver a package, the higher the shipping cost. Each carrier has their own zones that they use to calculate domestic shipping rates. However, international shipping becomes a bit trickier. Businesses that need to ship internationally should consider What products are illegal to transport into foreign countries. Additional tariffs, taxes, and customs fees. Reviewing the carrier’s updated international pricing and policies. Carriers want high shipment volumes to maintain their delivery frequency and increase profits. Therefore, businesses should consider how they can leverage shipping volumes in carrier contracts to reduce costs. If possible, companies should consolidate orders to optimize the available space on each carrier freight. This prevents having to take multiple trips to the same location, increasing transportation costs. While it is easy to just choose the cheapest shipping option available, this can negatively impact service quality. Instead, organizations should aim to reduce their primary carrier’s shipping costs to maintain quality standards. Some businesses have large shipment volumes and prefer carrier pick-up to save time and labor. While USPS offers scheduled pick-ups for free, UPS and FedEx both charge an additional fee. Companies that have the vehicles and labor resources available to drop off parcels should consider ditching the pick-up option to eliminate unnecessary carrier fees. However, financial advisors should first run the numbers to determine if the transportation, labor, and carrying costs associated with drop-off are, in fact, lower than the pick-up rate. Businesses with a high shipping frequency can often negotiate cheaper rates with their carriers. However, companies that are unable to maintain 100 or more sales a month can still ask for special discounts and exclusive deals. By negotiating contract terms, small businesses can create a long-lasting, symbiotic partnership with their primary vendors. Aside from the actual expense of shipping, packing materials can be costly. Although well-known brands offer a level of comfort and reliance, businesses should consider more cost-efficient options. Based on the company’s budget, managers should determine what packing supplies best suit their needs- Boxes Bubble wrap Packing peanuts Poly mailers Air fill Packing tape Many of these supplies can be bought in bulk to reduce prices. While many small businesses keep order fulfillment in-house because they have minimal inventory needs and want to maintain control, outsourcing fulfillment services can actually save time and money. Third-party logistics (3PL) are external companies that specialize in order fulfillment and use their own resources to receive, manage, and ship other businesses’ products. Although this may not be the most cost-efficient option for startups, small businesses should consider switching to 3PLs once their order volume increases.

page_content = How to Lower Shipping Costs for Small Businesses – 4 Ideas small business shipping Shipping costs for small businesses make up a significant proportion of order fulfillment expenses, making cost reduction practices critical for profitability. Shipping Cost Components Service and Speed Dimension and Weight Destination Shipping Volume How Small Businesses Can Reduce Shipping Costs Consider Pick-Up vs. Drop-Off Negotiate Rates Choose Affordable Packing Supplies Consider Outsourcing vs. In-House Fulfillment Many startups do not understand their options when it comes to inventory management, order fulfillment, and shipping. Depending on the company's customer and inventory types, they may experience inflated shipping costs. Therefore, owners should understand how shipping costs for small businesses are calculated to determine what methods best suit their budget. Before companies set their shipping rates, they weigh the four primary factors of each order. While consumers have always desired fast deliveries, online retail giants, such as Amazon, have significantly raised customers' expectations of shipment speed. As most people understand, the quicker the delivery speed, the more expensive the shipment. This means that expedited shipping is typically the most expensive option. However, the price also increases with every added service and shipping requirement, such as- Guaranteed delivery by date Tracking Insurance Specialized delivery instructions Required signature upon arrival Commercial, residential, or government building Shipping alcohol or hazardous materials Temperature-sensitive products Shipping rates also increase as the product's weight and size increase. These prices tend to vary between carrying companies based on their vehicles and space availability. The major carriers, including FedEx, USPS, and UPS, charge by a package's dimensional weight (DIM). In other words, the price of each shipment is calculated based on its size rather than weight. This means that large packages cost more to ship, even if they are lighter than a smaller, heavier parcel. To calculate DIM, businesses use a simple equation- DIM= (Length x Width x Height) / Divisor The divisor is determined by each individual carrier- UPS = 139 FedEx = 139 USPS = 166 The higher the divisor, the lower the shipping price, making USPS the most cost-efficient option when it comes to shipping larger parcels. However, most carriers offer a standardized shipping option, where shippers pay the flat rate for their package, regardless of its weight and size. USPS and UPS allow up to 70 pounds, whereas FedEx allows up to 50 pounds for their flat rate boxes. There is also cubic pricing, which is used to ship small, dense packages. The cubic pricing for Items under 20 pounds is calculated by- Cubic Feet = (Length x Width x Height) / 1728 The end value is then categorized into one of five groups that range from .1 to .5 cubic feet. The further the carrier has to travel to deliver a package, the higher the shipping cost. Each carrier has their own zones that they use to calculate domestic shipping rates. However, international shipping becomes a bit trickier. Businesses that need to ship internationally should consider What products are illegal to transport into foreign countries. Additional tariffs, taxes, and customs fees. Reviewing the carrier's updated international pricing and policies. Carriers want high shipment volumes to maintain their delivery frequency and increase profits. Therefore, businesses should consider how they can leverage shipping volumes in carrier contracts to reduce costs. If possible, companies should consolidate orders to optimize the available space on each carrier freight. This prevents having to take multiple trips to the same location, increasing transportation costs. While it is easy to just choose the cheapest shipping option available, this can negatively impact service quality. Instead, organizations should aim to reduce their primary carrier's shipping costs to maintain quality standards. Some businesses have large shipment volumes and prefer carrier pick-up to save time and labor. While USPS offers scheduled pick-ups for free, UPS and FedEx both charge an additional fee. Companies that have the vehicles and labor resources available to drop off parcels should consider ditching the pick-up option to eliminate unnecessary carrier fees. However, financial advisors should first run the numbers to determine if the transportation, labor, and carrying costs associated with drop-off are, in fact, lower than the pick-up rate. Businesses with a high shipping frequency can often negotiate cheaper rates with their carriers. However, companies that are unable to maintain 100 or more sales a month can still ask for special discounts and exclusive deals. By negotiating contract terms, small businesses can create a long-lasting, symbiotic partnership with their primary vendors. Aside from the actual expense of shipping, packing materials can be costly. Although well-known brands offer a level of comfort and reliance, businesses should consider more cost-efficient options. Based on the company's budget, managers should determine what packing supplies best suit their needs- Boxes Bubble wrap Packing peanuts Poly mailers Air fill Packing tape Many of these supplies can be bought in bulk to reduce prices. While many small businesses keep order fulfillment in-house because they have minimal inventory needs and want to maintain control, outsourcing fulfillment services can actually save time and money. Third-party logistics (3PL) are external companies that specialize in order fulfillment and use their own resources to receive, manage, and ship other businesses' products. Although this may not be the most cost-efficient option for startups, small businesses should consider switching to 3PLs once their order volume increases.

page_content = How to Lower Shipping Costs for Small Businesses – 4 Ideas small business shipping Shipping costs for small businesses make up a significant proportion of order fulfillment expenses, making cost reduction practices critical for profitability. Shipping Cost Components business shipping solutions Service and Speed Dimension and Weight Destination Shipping Volume How Small Businesses Can Reduce Shipping Costs Consider Pick-Up vs. Drop-Off Negotiate Rates Choose Affordable Packing Supplies Consider Outsourcing vs. In-House Fulfillment Many startups do not understand their options when it comes to inventory management, order fulfillment, and shipping. Depending on the company's customer and inventory types, they may experience inflated shipping costs. Therefore, owners should understand how shipping costs for small businesses are calculated to determine what methods best suit their budget. Before companies set their shipping rates, they weigh the four primary factors of each order. While consumers have always desired fast deliveries, online retail giants, such as Amazon, have significantly raised customers' expectations of shipment speed. As most people understand, the quicker the delivery speed, the more expensive the shipment. This means that expedited shipping is typically the most expensive option. However, the price also increases with every added service and shipping requirement, such as- Guaranteed delivery by date Tracking Insurance Specialized delivery instructions Required signature upon arrival Commercial, residential, or government building Shipping alcohol or hazardous materials Temperature-sensitive products Shipping rates also increase as the product's weight and size increase. These prices tend to vary between carrying companies based on their vehicles and space availability. The major carriers, including FedEx, USPS, and UPS, charge by a package's dimensional weight (DIM). In other words, the price of each shipment is calculated based on its size rather than weight. This means that large packages cost more to ship, even if they are lighter than a smaller, heavier parcel. To calculate DIM, businesses use a simple equation- DIM= (Length x Width x Height) / Divisor The divisor is determined by each individual carrier- UPS = 139 FedEx = 139 USPS = 166 The higher the divisor, the lower the shipping price, making USPS the most cost-efficient option when it comes to shipping larger parcels. However, most carriers offer a standardized shipping option, where shippers pay the flat rate for their package, regardless of its weight and size. USPS and UPS allow up to 70 pounds, whereas FedEx allows up to 50 pounds for their flat rate boxes. There is also cubic pricing, which is used to ship small, dense packages. The cubic pricing for Items under 20 pounds is calculated by- Cubic Feet = (Length x Width x Height) / 1728 The end value is then categorized into one of five groups that range from .1 to .5 cubic feet. The further the carrier has to travel to deliver a package, the higher the shipping cost. Each carrier has their own zones that they use to calculate domestic shipping rates. However, international shipping becomes a bit trickier. Businesses that need to ship internationally should consider What products are illegal to transport into foreign countries. Additional tariffs, taxes, and customs fees. Reviewing the carrier's updated international pricing and policies. Carriers want high shipment volumes to maintain their delivery frequency and increase profits. Therefore, businesses should consider how they can leverage shipping volumes in carrier contracts to reduce costs. If possible, companies should consolidate orders to optimize the available space on each carrier freight. This prevents having to take multiple trips to the same location, increasing transportation costs. While it is easy to just choose the cheapest shipping option available, this can negatively impact service quality. Instead, organizations should aim to reduce their primary carrier's shipping costs to maintain quality standards. Some businesses have large shipment volumes and prefer carrier pick-up to save time and labor. While USPS offers scheduled pick-ups for free, UPS and FedEx both charge an additional fee. Companies that have the vehicles and labor resources available to drop off parcels should consider ditching the pick-up option to eliminate unnecessary carrier fees. However, financial advisors should first run the numbers to determine if the transportation, labor, and carrying costs associated with drop-off are, in fact, lower than the pick-up rate. Businesses with a high shipping frequency can often negotiate cheaper rates with their carriers. However, companies that are unable to maintain 100 or more sales a month can still ask for special discounts and exclusive deals. By negotiating contract terms, small businesses can create a long-lasting, symbiotic partnership with their primary vendors. Aside from the actual expense of shipping, packing materials can be costly. Although well-known brands offer a level of comfort and reliance, businesses should consider more cost-efficient options. Based on the company's budget, managers should determine what packing supplies best suit their needs- Boxes Bubble wrap Packing peanuts Poly mailers Air fill Packing tape Many of these supplies can be bought in bulk to reduce prices. While many small businesses keep order fulfillment in-house because they have minimal inventory needs and want to maintain control, outsourcing fulfillment services can actually save time and money. Third-party logistics (3PL) are external companies that specialize in order fulfillment and use their own resources to receive, manage, and ship other businesses' products. Although this may not be the most cost-efficient option for startups, small businesses should consider switching to 3PLs once their order volume increases.

page_content = 6 Tips to Earn Success at Integrated Business Planning integrated business planning There are various tips available for professionals regarding integrated business planning processes. 6 Tips to Succeed at Integrated Business Planning 1. Delegation 2. Definition 3. Organization Tip: 4. Scouting 5. Analyzing Fact: 6. Upgrading Many business professionals have discovered the growing popularity of integrated business planning. In order to properly execute integrated business planning, professionals must understand what it entails. Integrated business planning is defined as a comprehensive plan that connects strategic plans with operational, sales, and financial planning initiatives with consideration of both financial objectives and resources available. Integrated business planning offers organizations various significant benefits. Increased accountability and alignment are often referenced as a top benefit of successful integrated business planning. Organizations often dedicate a massive amount of employee time and labor costs debating which plans are worth undertaking. Alternatively, integrated business planning allows team members to agree upon a plan as well as clearly comprehend their role within it. When everyone involved in integrated business planning is working together, not against one another, the entire organization benefits. The employee time and labor costs that would have otherwise been wasted on debating can be redirected towards integrated business planning initiatives. Another noteworthy benefit of successful integrated business planning is increased visibility. Increased visibility is accomplished through the incorporation of insights from supply chain projections, strategic planning initiatives, and financial operational projects. The larger the number of insights incorporated, the more well informed decision making capabilities are. Well informed decision making capabilities directly translate into more comprehensive action steps formulated. Ultimately, better decision making is likely to contribute towards business goal achievements. Tips and best practices for integrated business planning include:Great integrated business planning requires strong leadership. As such, a qualified executive must be assigned to the role of overseeing the integrated business planning process. The leader of integrated business planning will be in charge of a variety of tasks including real time consulting duties as well as efforts towards aligning stakeholders. The integrated business planning leader is also responsible for creating a work environment that allows team members to work together effectively. Of course, the leader of integrated business planning may request help from human resources and other business management professionals. Ultimately, the leader is responsible for integrated business planning running effectively.Defining a clear mission is crucial for integrated business planning success. Well defined objectives are also important for establishing what integrated business planning hopes to accomplish. Alternatively, a lack of well defined objectives will likely result in wasted available resources.The real time effort that the integrated business planning team puts towards organizing pays off in the long run. Best practices assert that processes must be both cross functional and well designed. When the entire team is aligned and motivated to achieve a common objective, less time is wasted on unnecessary process maintenance. Best practices state that processes must be cross functional and well designed for optimal integrated business planning success. A great integrated business planning team should be comprised of individuals that possess a wide range of knowledge, expertise, and skills. Two skills necessary for integrated business planning are strategic planning and supply chain planning. Excellent financial planning skills are also desirable for optimal integrated business planning success. As a result of successfully identifying team members with these skillsets, integrated business planning implementation will likely be much easier.The increased digital transformation of outdated business processes has supplied businesses with more real time advanced analytics accesible than ever before. However, an organization must know how to utilize real time advanced analytics properly. Real time advanced analytics supply integrated business planning team members with scenario planning capabilities. Another benefit that real time analytics supports is improved decision making capabilities. Overall business performance and financial planning are also improved through the information that real time advanced analytics supplies. For example, advanced analytics could help business professionals predict long term market patterns. Instead of a business being more reactive, proactivity is encouraged through real time data analytics accessibility. The potential for proactivity that real time advanced analytics supplies affords businesses the opportunity to gain and maintain a competitive advantage. Digital transformation of outdated business processes has furnished organizations with more real time advanced analytics than ever before. Too often businesses expect outstanding results without utilizing the proper tools. Similar to real time advanced analytics, artificial intelligence tools are not useful if they are not properly understood. Due to the fact that integrated business planning is a cross functional initiative, artificial intelligence tools are necessary to suitably support it. The best tools will offer users agility, flexibility, and cross functional collaboration capabilities. Especially for teams that are remote or otherwise not in the same geographical location, cloud based artificial intelligence tools are essential. Overall, successful integrated business planning initiatives require cross functional collaborative tools.

page_content = How to Lower Shipping Costs for Small Businesses – 4 Ideas small business shipping Shipping costs for small businesses make up a significant proportion of order fulfillment expenses, making cost reduction practices critical for profitability. Shipping Cost Components business shipping solutions Service and Speed Dimension and Weight shipping small business Destination states postal service Shipping Volume How Small Businesses Can Reduce Shipping Costs ups ups Consider Pick-Up vs. Drop-Off Negotiate Rates businesses ship Choose Affordable Packing Supplies Consider Outsourcing vs. In-House Fulfillment Many startups do not understand their options when it comes to inventory management, order fulfillment, and shipping. Depending on the company's customer and inventory types, they may experience inflated shipping costs. Therefore, owners should understand how shipping costs for small businesses are calculated to determine what methods best suit their budget. Before companies set their shipping rates, they weigh the four primary factors of each order. While consumers have always desired fast deliveries, online retail giants, such as Amazon, have significantly raised customers' expectations of shipment speed. As most people understand, the quicker the delivery speed, the more expensive the shipment. This means that expedited shipping is typically the most expensive option. However, the price also increases with every added service and shipping requirement, such as- Guaranteed delivery by date Tracking Insurance Specialized delivery instructions Required signature upon arrival Commercial, residential, or government building Shipping alcohol or hazardous materials Temperature-sensitive products Shipping rates also increase as the product's weight and size increase. These prices tend to vary between carrying companies based on their vehicles and space availability. The major carriers, including FedEx, USPS, and UPS, charge by a package's dimensional weight (DIM). In other words, the price of each shipment is calculated based on its size rather than weight. This means that large packages cost more to ship, even if they are lighter than a smaller, heavier parcel. To calculate DIM, businesses use a simple equation- DIM= (Length x Width x Height) / Divisor The divisor is determined by each individual carrier- UPS = 139 FedEx = 139 USPS = 166 The higher the divisor, the lower the shipping price, making USPS the most cost-efficient option when it comes to shipping larger parcels. However, most carriers offer a standardized shipping option, where shippers pay the flat rate for their package, regardless of its weight and size. USPS and UPS allow up to 70 pounds, whereas FedEx allows up to 50 pounds for their flat rate boxes. There is also cubic pricing, which is used to ship small, dense packages. The cubic pricing for Items under 20 pounds is calculated by- Cubic Feet = (Length x Width x Height) / 1728 The end value is then categorized into one of five groups that range from .1 to .5 cubic feet. The further the carrier has to travel to deliver a package, the higher the shipping cost. Each carrier has their own zones that they use to calculate domestic shipping rates. However, international shipping becomes a bit trickier. Businesses that need to ship internationally should consider What products are illegal to transport into foreign countries. Additional tariffs, taxes, and customs fees. Reviewing the carrier's updated international pricing and policies. Carriers want high shipment volumes to maintain their delivery frequency and increase profits. Therefore, businesses should consider how they can leverage shipping volumes in carrier contracts to reduce costs. If possible, companies should consolidate orders to optimize the available space on each carrier freight. This prevents having to take multiple trips to the same location, increasing transportation costs. While it is easy to just choose the cheapest shipping option available, this can negatively impact service quality. Instead, organizations should aim to reduce their primary carrier's shipping costs to maintain quality standards. Some businesses have large shipment volumes and prefer carrier pick-up to save time and labor. While USPS offers scheduled pick-ups for free, UPS and FedEx both charge an additional fee. Companies that have the vehicles and labor resources available to drop off parcels should consider ditching the pick-up option to eliminate unnecessary carrier fees. However, financial advisors should first run the numbers to determine if the transportation, labor, and carrying costs associated with drop-off are, in fact, lower than the pick-up rate. Businesses with a high shipping frequency can often negotiate cheaper rates with their carriers. However, companies that are unable to maintain 100 or more sales a month can still ask for special discounts and exclusive deals. By negotiating contract terms, small businesses can create a long-lasting, symbiotic partnership with their primary vendors. Aside from the actual expense of shipping, packing materials can be costly. Although well-known brands offer a level of comfort and reliance, businesses should consider more cost-efficient options. Based on the company's budget, managers should determine what packing supplies best suit their needs- Boxes Bubble wrap Packing peanuts Poly mailers Air fill Packing tape Many of these supplies can be bought in bulk to reduce prices. While many small businesses keep order fulfillment in-house because they have minimal inventory needs and want to maintain control, outsourcing fulfillment services can actually save time and money. Third-party logistics (3PL) are external companies that specialize in order fulfillment and use their own resources to receive, manage, and ship other businesses' products. Although this may not be the most cost-efficient option for startups, small businesses should consider switching to 3PLs once their order volume increases.

page_content = How to Lower Shipping Costs for Small Businesses – 4 Ideas small business shipping Shipping costs for small businesses make up a significant proportion of order fulfillment expenses, making cost reduction practices critical for profitability. Shipping Cost Components business shipping solutions Service and Speed Dimension and Weight shipping small business Destination states postal service Shipping Volume How Small Businesses Can Reduce Shipping Costs ups ups Consider Pick-Up vs. Drop-Off Negotiate Rates businesses ship Choose Affordable Packing Supplies Consider Outsourcing vs. In-House Fulfillment business owners Many startups do not understand their options when it comes to inventory management, order fulfillment, and shipping. Depending on the company's customer and inventory types, they may experience inflated shipping costs. Therefore, owners should understand how shipping costs for small businesses are calculated to determine what methods best suit their budget. Before companies set their shipping rates, they weigh the four primary factors of each order. While consumers have always desired fast deliveries, online retail giants, such as Amazon, have significantly raised customers' expectations of shipment speed. As most people understand, the quicker the delivery speed, the more expensive the shipment. This means that expedited shipping is typically the most expensive option. However, the price also increases with every added service and shipping requirement, such as- Guaranteed delivery by date Tracking Insurance Specialized delivery instructions Required signature upon arrival Commercial, residential, or government building Shipping alcohol or hazardous materials Temperature-sensitive products Shipping rates also increase as the product's weight and size increase. These prices tend to vary between carrying companies based on their vehicles and space availability. The major carriers, including FedEx, USPS, and UPS, charge by a package's dimensional weight (DIM). In other words, the price of each shipment is calculated based on its size rather than weight. This means that large packages cost more to ship, even if they are lighter than a smaller, heavier parcel. To calculate DIM, businesses use a simple equation- DIM= (Length x Width x Height) / Divisor The divisor is determined by each individual carrier- UPS = 139 FedEx = 139 USPS = 166 The higher the divisor, the lower the shipping price, making USPS the most cost-efficient option when it comes to shipping larger parcels. However, most carriers offer a standardized shipping option, where shippers pay the flat rate for their package, regardless of its weight and size. USPS and UPS allow up to 70 pounds, whereas FedEx allows up to 50 pounds for their flat rate boxes. There is also cubic pricing, which is used to ship small, dense packages. The cubic pricing for Items under 20 pounds is calculated by- Cubic Feet = (Length x Width x Height) / 1728 The end value is then categorized into one of five groups that range from .1 to .5 cubic feet. The further the carrier has to travel to deliver a package, the higher the shipping cost. Each carrier has their own zones that they use to calculate domestic shipping rates. However, international shipping becomes a bit trickier. Businesses that need to ship internationally should consider What products are illegal to transport into foreign countries. Additional tariffs, taxes, and customs fees. Reviewing the carrier's updated international pricing and policies. Carriers want high shipment volumes to maintain their delivery frequency and increase profits. Therefore, businesses should consider how they can leverage shipping volumes in carrier contracts to reduce costs. If possible, companies should consolidate orders to optimize the available space on each carrier freight. This prevents having to take multiple trips to the same location, increasing transportation costs. While it is easy to just choose the cheapest shipping option available, this can negatively impact service quality. Instead, organizations should aim to reduce their primary carrier's shipping costs to maintain quality standards. Some businesses have large shipment volumes and prefer carrier pick-up to save time and labor. While USPS offers scheduled pick-ups for free, UPS and FedEx both charge an additional fee. Companies that have the vehicles and labor resources available to drop off parcels should consider ditching the pick-up option to eliminate unnecessary carrier fees. However, financial advisors should first run the numbers to determine if the transportation, labor, and carrying costs associated with drop-off are, in fact, lower than the pick-up rate. Businesses with a high shipping frequency can often negotiate cheaper rates with their carriers. However, companies that are unable to maintain 100 or more sales a month can still ask for special discounts and exclusive deals. By negotiating contract terms, small businesses can create a long-lasting, symbiotic partnership with their primary vendors. Aside from the actual expense of shipping, packing materials can be costly. Although well-known brands offer a level of comfort and reliance, businesses should consider more cost-efficient options. Based on the company's budget, managers should determine what packing supplies best suit their needs- Boxes Bubble wrap Packing peanuts Poly mailers Air fill Packing tape Many of these supplies can be bought in bulk to reduce prices. While many small businesses keep order fulfillment in-house because they have minimal inventory needs and want to maintain control, outsourcing fulfillment services can actually save time and money. Third-party logistics (3PL) are external companies that specialize in order fulfillment and use their own resources to receive, manage, and ship other businesses' products. Although this may not be the most cost-efficient option for startups, small businesses should consider switching to 3PLs once their order volume increases.

keyword = Shipping Costs For Small Business
page_content = How to Lower Shipping Costs for Small Businesses – 4 Ideas small business shipping Shipping costs for small businesses make up a significant proportion of order fulfillment expenses, making cost reduction practices critical for profitability. Shipping Cost Components business shipping solutions Service and Speed Dimension and Weight shipping small business Destination states postal service Shipping Volume How Small Businesses Can Reduce Shipping Costs ups ups Consider Pick-Up vs. Drop-Off Negotiate Rates businesses ship Choose Affordable Packing Supplies Consider Outsourcing vs. In-House Fulfillment business owners Many startups do not understand their options when it comes to inventory management, order fulfillment, and shipping. Depending on the company's customer and inventory types, they may experience inflated shipping costs. Therefore, owners should understand how shipping costs for small businesses are calculated to determine what methods best suit their budget. Before companies set their shipping rates, they weigh the four primary factors of each order. While consumers have always desired fast deliveries, online retail giants, such as Amazon, have significantly raised customers' expectations of shipment speed. As most people understand, the quicker the delivery speed, the more expensive the shipment. This means that expedited shipping is typically the most expensive option. However, the price also increases with every added service and shipping requirement, such as- Guaranteed delivery by date Tracking Insurance Specialized delivery instructions Required signature upon arrival Commercial, residential, or government building Shipping alcohol or hazardous materials Temperature-sensitive products Shipping rates also increase as the product's weight and size increase. These prices tend to vary between carrying companies based on their vehicles and space availability. The major carriers, including FedEx, United States Postal Service ( USPS), and United Parcel Service (UPS), charge by a package's dimensional weight (DIM). In other words, the price of each shipment is calculated based on its size rather than weight. This means that large packages cost more to ship, even if they are lighter than a smaller, heavier parcel. To calculate DIM, businesses use a simple equation- DIM= (Length x Width x Height) / Divisor The divisor is determined by each individual carrier- UPS = 139 FedEx = 139 USPS = 166 The higher the divisor, the lower the shipping price, making USPS the most cost-efficient option when it comes to shipping larger parcels. However, most carriers offer a standardized shipping option, where shippers pay the flat rate for their package, regardless of its weight and size. USPS and UPS allow up to 70 pounds, whereas FedEx allows up to 50 pounds for their flat rate boxes. There is also cubic pricing, which is used to ship small, dense packages. The cubic pricing for Items under 20 pounds is calculated by- Cubic Feet = (Length x Width x Height) / 1728 The end value is then categorized into one of five groups that range from .1 to .5 cubic feet. The further the carrier has to travel to deliver a package, the higher the shipping cost. Each carrier has their own zones that they use to calculate domestic shipping rates. However, international shipping becomes a bit trickier. Businesses that need to ship internationally should consider What products are illegal to transport into foreign countries. Additional tariffs, taxes, and customs fees. Reviewing the carrier's updated international pricing and policies. Carriers want high shipment volumes to maintain their delivery frequency and increase profits. Therefore, businesses should consider how they can leverage shipping volumes in carrier contracts to reduce costs. If possible, companies should consolidate orders to optimize the available space on each carrier freight. This prevents having to take multiple trips to the same location, increasing transportation costs. While it is easy to just choose the cheapest shipping option available, this can negatively impact service quality. Instead, organizations should aim to reduce their primary carrier's shipping costs to maintain quality standards. Some businesses have large shipment volumes and prefer carrier pick-up to save time and labor. While USPS offers scheduled pick-ups for free, UPS and FedEx both charge an additional fee. Companies that have the vehicles and labor resources available to drop off parcels should consider ditching the pick-up option to eliminate unnecessary carrier fees. However, financial advisors should first run the numbers to determine if the transportation, labor, and carrying costs associated with drop-off are, in fact, lower than the pick-up rate. Businesses with a high shipping frequency can often negotiate cheaper rates with their carriers. However, companies that are unable to maintain 100 or more sales a month can still ask for special discounts and exclusive deals. By negotiating contract terms, small businesses can create a long-lasting, symbiotic partnership with their primary vendors. Aside from the actual expense of shipping, packing materials can be costly. Although well-known brands offer a level of comfort and reliance, businesses should consider more cost-efficient options. Based on the company's budget, managers should determine what packing supplies best suit their needs- Boxes Bubble wrap Packing peanuts Poly mailers Air fill Packing tape Many of these supplies can be bought in bulk to reduce prices. While many small businesses keep order fulfillment in-house because they have minimal inventory needs and want to maintain control, outsourcing fulfillment services can actually save time and money. Third-party logistics (3PL) are external companies that specialize in order fulfillment and use their own resources to receive, manage, and ship other businesses' products. Although this may not be the most cost-efficient option for startups, small businesses should consider switching to 3PLs once their order volume increases.

page_content = How to Lower Shipping Costs for Small Businesses – 4 Ideas small business shipping Shipping costs for small businesses make up a significant proportion of order fulfillment expenses, making cost reduction practices critical for profitability. Shipping Cost Components business shipping solutions Service and Speed Dimension and Weight shipping small business Destination states postal service Shipping Volume How Small Businesses Can Reduce Shipping Costs ups ups Consider Pick-Up vs. Drop-Off Negotiate Rates businesses ship Choose Affordable Packing Supplies Consider Outsourcing vs. In-House Fulfillment business owners Many startups do not understand their options when it comes to inventory management, order fulfillment, and shipping. Depending on the company's customer and inventory types, they may experience inflated shipping costs. Therefore, owners should understand how shipping costs for small businesses are calculated to determine what methods best suit their budget. Before companies set their shipping rates, they weigh the four primary factors of each order. While consumers have always desired fast deliveries, online retail giants, such as Amazon, have significantly raised customers' expectations of shipment speed. As most people understand, the quicker the delivery speed, the more expensive the shipment. This means that expedited shipping is typically the most expensive option. However, the price also increases with every added service and shipping requirement, such as- Guaranteed delivery by date Tracking Insurance Specialized delivery instructions Required signature upon arrival Commercial, residential, or government building Shipping alcohol or hazardous materials Temperature-sensitive products Shipping rates also increase as the product's weight and size increase. These prices tend to vary between carrying companies based on their vehicles and space availability. The major carriers, including FedEx, United States Postal Service (USPS), and United Parcel Service (UPS), charge by a package's dimensional weight (DIM). In other words, the price of each shipment is calculated based on its size rather than weight. This means that large packages cost more to ship, even if they are lighter than a smaller, heavier parcel. To calculate DIM, businesses use a simple equation- DIM= (Length x Width x Height) / Divisor The divisor is determined by each individual carrier- UPS = 139 FedEx = 139 USPS = 166 The higher the divisor, the lower the shipping price, making USPS the most cost-efficient option when it comes to shipping larger parcels. However, most carriers offer a standardized shipping option, where shippers pay the flat rate for their package, regardless of its weight and size. USPS and UPS allow up to 70 pounds, whereas FedEx allows up to 50 pounds for their flat rate boxes. There is also cubic pricing, which is used to ship small, dense packages. The cubic pricing for Items under 20 pounds is calculated by- Cubic Feet = (Length x Width x Height) / 1728 The end value is then categorized into one of five groups that range from .1 to .5 cubic feet. The further the carrier has to travel to deliver a package, the higher the shipping cost. Each carrier has their own zones that they use to calculate domestic shipping rates. However, international shipping becomes a bit trickier. Businesses that need to ship internationally should consider What products are illegal to transport into foreign countries. Additional tariffs, taxes, and customs fees. Reviewing the carrier's updated international pricing and policies. Carriers want high shipment volumes to maintain their delivery frequency and increase profits. Therefore, businesses should consider how they can leverage shipping volumes in carrier contracts to reduce costs. If possible, companies should consolidate orders to optimize the available space on each carrier freight. This prevents having to take multiple trips to the same location, increasing transportation costs. While it is easy to just choose the cheapest shipping option available, this can negatively impact service quality. Instead, organizations should aim to reduce their primary carrier's shipping costs to maintain quality standards. Some businesses have large shipment volumes and prefer carrier pick-up to save time and labor. While USPS offers scheduled pick-ups for free, UPS and FedEx both charge an additional fee. Companies that have the vehicles and labor resources available to drop off parcels should consider ditching the pick-up option to eliminate unnecessary carrier fees. However, financial advisors should first run the numbers to determine if the transportation, labor, and carrying costs associated with drop-off are, in fact, lower than the pick-up rate. Businesses with a high shipping frequency can often negotiate cheaper rates with their carriers. However, companies that are unable to maintain 100 or more sales a month can still ask for special discounts and exclusive deals. By negotiating contract terms, small businesses can create a long-lasting, symbiotic partnership with their primary vendors. Aside from the actual expense of shipping, packing materials can be costly. Although well-known brands offer a level of comfort and reliance, businesses should consider more cost-efficient options. Based on the company's budget, managers should determine what packing supplies best suit their needs- Boxes Bubble wrap Packing peanuts Poly mailers Air fill Packing tape Many of these supplies can be bought in bulk to reduce prices. While many small businesses keep order fulfillment in-house because they have minimal inventory needs and want to maintain control, outsourcing fulfillment services can actually save time and money. Third-party logistics (3PL) are external companies that specialize in order fulfillment and use their own resources to receive, manage, and ship other businesses' products. Although this may not be the most cost-efficient option for startups, small businesses should consider switching to 3PLs once their order volume increases.

Sanjiv Sidhu, Chairman and Founder of o9 Solutions, explains Integrated Business Planning and shares the story of Mr. Herman Lay from Frito Lay. 1. Delegation 2. Definition Integrated business planning 3. Organization Tip: 4. Scouting Integrated business planning 5. Analyzing Fact: 6. Upgrading Integrated business planning Conclusion Many business professionals have discovered the growing popularity of integrated business planning. In order to properly execute integrated business planning, professionals must understand what it entails. Integrated business planning is defined as a comprehensive plan that connects strategic plans with operational, sales, and financial planning initiatives with consideration of both financial objectives and resources available. Integrated business planning offers organizations various significant benefits. Increased accountability and alignment are often referenced as a top benefit of successful integrated business planning. Organizations often dedicate a massive amount of employee time and labor costs debating which plans are worth undertaking. Alternatively, integrated business planning allows team members to agree upon a plan as well as clearly comprehend their role within it. When everyone involved in integrated business planning is working together, not against one another, the entire organization benefits. The employee time and labor costs that would have otherwise been wasted on debating can be redirected towards integrated business planning initiatives. Another noteworthy benefit of successful integrated business planning is increased visibility. Increased visibility is accomplished through the incorporation of insights from supply chain projections, strategic planning initiatives, and financial operational projects. The larger the number of insights incorporated, the more well informed decision making capabilities are. Well informed decision making capabilities directly translate into more comprehensive action steps formulated. Ultimately, better decision making is likely to contribute towards business goal achievements. Tips and best practices for integrated business planning include:Great integrated business planning requires strong leadership. As such, a qualified executive must be assigned to the role of overseeing the integrated business planning process. The leader of integrated business planning will be in charge of a variety of tasks including real time consulting duties as well as efforts towards aligning stakeholders. The integrated business planning leader is also responsible for creating a work environment that allows team members to work together effectively. Of course, the leader of integrated business planning may request help from human resources and other business management professionals. Ultimately, the leader is responsible for integrated business planning running effectively.Defining a clear mission is crucial for integrated business planning success. Well defined objectives are also important for establishing what integrated business planning hopes to accomplish. Alternatively, a lack of well defined objectives will likely result in wasted available resources.The real time effort that the integrated business planning team puts towards organizing pays off in the long run. Best practices assert that processes must be both cross functional and well designed. When the entire team is aligned and motivated to achieve a common objective, less time is wasted on unnecessary process maintenance. Best practices state that processes must be cross functional and well designed for optimal integrated business planning success. A great integrated business planning team should be comprised of individuals that possess a wide range of knowledge, expertise, and skills. Two skills necessary for integrated business planning are strategic planning and supply chain planning. Excellent financial planning skills are also desirable for optimal integrated business planning success. As a result of successfully identifying team members with these skillsets, integrated business planning implementation will likely be much easier.The increased digital transformation of outdated business processes has supplied businesses with more real time advanced analytics accesible than ever before. However, an organization must know how to utilize real time advanced analytics properly. Real time advanced analytics supply integrated business planning team members with scenario planning capabilities. Another benefit that real time analytics supports is improved decision making capabilities. Overall business performance and financial planning are also improved through the information that real time advanced analytics supplies. For example, advanced analytics could help business professionals predict long term market patterns. Instead of a business being more reactive, proactivity is encouraged through real time data analytics accessibility. The potential for proactivity that real time advanced analytics supplies affords businesses the opportunity to gain and maintain a competitive advantage. Digital transformation of outdated business processes has furnished organizations with more real time advanced analytics than ever before. Too often businesses expect outstanding results without utilizing the proper tools. Similar to real time advanced analytics, artificial intelligence tools are not useful if they are not properly understood. Due to the fact that integrated business planning is a cross functional initiative, artificial intelligence tools are necessary to suitably support it. The best tools will offer users agility, flexibility, and cross functional collaboration capabilities. Especially for teams that are remote or otherwise not in the same geographical location, cloud based artificial intelligence tools are essential. Overall, successful integrated business planning initiatives require cross functional collaborative tools. Successful integrated business planning execution is much more likely to occur with best practices adherence. Best practices and tips for successful integrated business planning execution include proper delegation and utilization of cross functional collaborative tools.

page_content = How to Lower Shipping Costs for Small Businesses – 4 Ideas small business shipping Shipping costs for small businesses make up a significant proportion of order fulfillment expenses, making cost reduction practices critical for profitability. Shipping Cost Components business shipping solutions Service and Speed Dimension and Weight shipping small business Destination states postal service Shipping Volume How Small Businesses Can Reduce Shipping Costs ups ups Consider Pick-Up vs. Drop-Off Negotiate Rates businesses ship Choose Affordable Packing Supplies Consider Outsourcing vs. In-House Fulfillment business owners Many startups do not understand their options when it comes to inventory management, order fulfillment , and shipping. Depending on the company's customer and inventory types, they may experience inflated shipping costs. Therefore, owners should understand how shipping costs for small businesses are calculated to determine what methods best suit their budget. Before companies set their shipping rates, they weigh the four primary factors of each order. While consumers have always desired fast deliveries, online retail giants, such as Amazon, have significantly raised customers' expectations of shipment speed. As most people understand, the quicker the delivery speed, the more expensive the shipment. This means that expedited shipping is typically the most expensive option. However, the price also increases with every added service and shipping requirement, such as- Guaranteed delivery by date Tracking Insurance Specialized delivery instructions Required signature upon arrival Commercial, residential, or government building Shipping alcohol or hazardous materials Temperature-sensitive products Shipping rates also increase as the product's weight and size increase. These prices tend to vary between carrying companies based on their vehicles and space availability. The major carriers, including FedEx, United States Postal Service (USPS), and United Parcel Service (UPS), charge by a package's dimensional weight (DIM). In other words, the price of each shipment is calculated based on its size rather than weight. This means that large packages cost more to ship, even if they are lighter than a smaller, heavier parcel. To calculate DIM, businesses use a simple equation- DIM= (Length x Width x Height) / Divisor The divisor is determined by each individual carrier- UPS = 139 FedEx = 139 USPS = 166 The higher the divisor, the lower the shipping price, making USPS the most cost-efficient option when it comes to shipping larger parcels. However, most carriers offer a standardized shipping option, where shippers pay the flat rate for their package, regardless of its weight and size. USPS and UPS allow up to 70 pounds, whereas FedEx allows up to 50 pounds for their flat rate boxes. There is also cubic pricing, which is used to ship small, dense packages. The cubic pricing for Items under 20 pounds is calculated by- Cubic Feet = (Length x Width x Height) / 1728 The end value is then categorized into one of five groups that range from .1 to .5 cubic feet. The further the carrier has to travel to deliver a package, the higher the shipping cost. Each carrier has their own zones that they use to calculate domestic shipping rates. However, international shipping becomes a bit trickier. Businesses that need to ship internationally should consider What products are illegal to transport into foreign countries. Additional tariffs, taxes, and customs fees. Reviewing the carrier's updated international pricing and policies. Carriers want high shipment volumes to maintain their delivery frequency and increase profits. Therefore, businesses should consider how they can leverage shipping volumes in carrier contracts to reduce costs. If possible, companies should consolidate orders to optimize the available space on each carrier freight. This prevents having to take multiple trips to the same location, increasing transportation costs. While it is easy to just choose the cheapest shipping option available, this can negatively impact service quality. Instead, organizations should aim to reduce their primary carrier's shipping costs to maintain quality standards. Some businesses have large shipment volumes and prefer carrier pick-up to save time and labor. While USPS offers scheduled pick-ups for free, UPS and FedEx both charge an additional fee. Companies that have the vehicles and labor resources available to drop off parcels should consider ditching the pick-up option to eliminate unnecessary carrier fees. However, financial advisors should first run the numbers to determine if the transportation, labor, and carrying costs associated with drop-off are, in fact, lower than the pick-up rate. Businesses with a high shipping frequency can often negotiate cheaper rates with their carriers. However, companies that are unable to maintain 100 or more sales a month can still ask for special discounts and exclusive deals. By negotiating contract terms, small businesses can create a long-lasting, symbiotic partnership with their primary vendors. Aside from the actual expense of shipping, packing materials can be costly. Although well-known brands offer a level of comfort and reliance, businesses should consider more cost-efficient options. Based on the company's budget, managers should determine what packing supplies best suit their needs- Boxes Bubble wrap Packing peanuts Poly mailers Air fill Packing tape Many of these supplies can be bought in bulk to reduce prices. While many small businesses keep order fulfillment in-house because they have minimal inventory needs and want to maintain control, outsourcing fulfillment services can actually save time and money. Third-party logistics (3PL) are external companies that specialize in order fulfillment and use their own resources to receive, manage, and ship other businesses' products. Although this may not be the most cost-efficient option for startups, small businesses should consider switching to 3PLs once their order volume increases.

page_content = How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs Fulfillment costs are accounting values that measure how much resources a warehouse or fulfillment center uses while receiving, storing, maintaining, and picking inventory. What are Fulfillment Costs? The Breakdown of Fulfillment Costs Setup Fees Intake Fees Storage Fees Pick and Pack Fees Shipping Fees Kitting Fees Return Fees Account Management Fees How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs Regardless of whether a business uses in-house or third-party fulfillment methods, they must supplement the labor, resources, and materials required to complete customer orders. However, in contrast to popular belief, order fulfillment costs extend further than just packing and shipping products. These expenses often include acceptance, store, and other inventory maintenance fees, which can quickly add up. Therefore, companies should take the time to understand exactly what fulfillment centers can charge. Fulfillment costs refer to the total expense accrued from fulfilling customer orders. Typical fulfillment costs include Receiving inventory Storage Product picking Packing supplies Shipments Processing returns Many businesses only factor in the labor required to fulfill orders. However, this is a very limited scope of the entire fulfillment process. Studies show that companies that only consider labor costs neglect up to 50% of the total fulfillment expense. When calculating fulfillment costs, organizations need to include all overhead, inventory, occupancy, labor, and material expenses to get a holistic view of their finances. While some businesses have in-house fulfillment and others use a third-party, there are several fees that contribute to the total fulfillment cost. Setup fees are usually a one-time expense based on the type of business and average order volume. Some fulfillment centers charge on an order-by-order basis, while others set a flat rate. These prices rise with specialty packaging, storage, and delivery. Intake fees, also referred to as receiving costs, supplement the expense of the systems that accept and process incoming inventory. Typically, intake fees are charged per hour, per item, or per inventory unit, which often varies between each product line. Storage fees also tend to fluctuate based on product size, weight, temperature sensitivity, and any storage requirements. Some stock may require a forklift to move around the warehouse, increasing storage fees. Other items may take up more of the storage unit space than others, also increasing expenses. Therefore, warehouses may charge per pallet or amount of space a business uses on a monthly basis. Pick and pack fees refer to the labor required to retrieve an item from storage and package it for the final delivery. These fees commonly range from $3-$5 per unit, depending on the product's size and weight. However, some fulfillment companies offer discount rates when orders contain multiple items, whereas others may actually add an additional fee. Therefore, retailers need to doublecheck how these fees change for consolidated shipments. Shipment fees cover the amount it costs to ship an item from the fulfillment center to the customer. Sometimes the fulfillment center handles the final delivery, while some retailers prefer to use a separate carrier. Kitting fees only apply to items with several components that require assembly before shipment. These fines are sometimes also applied when assembled products are returned and need to be broken down. Return costs are only applicable to customer returns that are damaged or defective. The fees supplement the acceptance and processing of returned products, including handling, assembly, and inspection. Account management fees are added to the monthly invoice to cover administrative costs, such as office supplies and handling customer support inquiries. Calculating fulfillment costs is tricky as there is no one-size-fits-all formula that works for every company. Instead, businesses need to total all of their fees from each supplier to get an exact figure. As a safety measure, organizations that estimate their fulfillment expenses should set aside at least 10% more funds to ensure they can cover financial obligations. To calculate fulfillment costs, businesses must first determine the- · Fulfillment providers’ rates (per unit, product, or timeframe) · Number of pallets, orders, and product units for the accounting period After all of the values are defined, they are added to determine the total fulfillment expense for that accounting cycle. However, this figure is only as accurate as the estimated values. Therefore, companies should have a solution that records each cost. For example, a retailer sells assembled tables, and their fulfillment center charges them · $3 per unit for storage · $2 per unit for picking and packing · $2 per unit for kitting fee · $5 per unit for shipping · $2 per unit for intake fees · $30 monthly for administration fees · $9 per unit for returns · $40 for a one-time setup fee For the first quarter, the business sold 330 tables and had four customer returns, meaning their total fulfillment cost for the first four months was $4,816: 330 tables x $3 = $990 for storage 330 tables x $2= $660 for picking and packing 330 tables x $2 = $660 for kitting 330 tables x $5 = $1,650 for shipping 330 tables x $2 = $660 for intake 4 months x $30 = $120 for administration 4 returns x $9 = $36 for returns $990+$660+$660+$1650+$660+$120+$36+$40=$4,816 It is important to note that as long as the business reduced their customer returns and maintained their sales, their fulfillment cost would decrease as the set-up fee is not recurring.

page_content = How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs fulfillment cost per Fulfillment costs are accounting values that measure how much resources a warehouse or fulfillment center uses while receiving, storing, maintaining, and picking inventory. What are Fulfillment Costs? The Breakdown of Fulfillment Costs Setup Fees Intake Fees Storage Fees Pick and Pack Fees Shipping Fees Kitting Fees Return Fees Account Management Fees How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs Regardless of whether a business uses in-house or third-party fulfillment methods, they must supplement the labor, resources, and materials required to complete customer orders. However, in contrast to popular belief, order fulfillment costs extend further than just packing and shipping products. These expenses often include acceptance, store, and other inventory maintenance fees, which can quickly add up. Therefore, companies should take the time to understand exactly what fulfillment centers can charge. Fulfillment costs refer to the total expense accrued from fulfilling customer orders. Typical fulfillment costs include Receiving inventory Storage Product picking Packing supplies Shipments Processing returns Many businesses only factor in the labor required to fulfill orders. However, this is a very limited scope of the entire fulfillment process. Studies show that companies that only consider labor costs neglect up to 50% of the total fulfillment expense. When calculating fulfillment costs, organizations need to include all overhead, inventory, occupancy, labor, and material expenses to get a holistic view of their finances. While some businesses have in-house fulfillment and others use a third-party, there are several fees that contribute to the total fulfillment cost.Setup fees are usually a one-time expense based on the type of business and average order volume. Some fulfillment centers charge on an order-by-order basis, while others set a flat rate. These prices rise with specialty packaging, storage, and delivery.Intake fees, also referred to as receiving costs, supplement the expense of the systems that accept and process incoming inventory. Typically, intake fees are charged per hour, per item, or per inventory unit, which often varies between each product line. Storage fees also tend to fluctuate based on product size, weight, temperature sensitivity, and any storage requirements. Some stock may require a forklift to move around the warehouse, increasing storage fees. Other items may take up more of the storage unit space than others, also increasing expenses. Therefore, warehouses may charge per pallet or amount of space a business uses on a monthly basis.Pick and pack fees refer to the labor required to retrieve an item from storage and package it for the final delivery. These fees commonly range from $3-$5 per unit, depending on the product's size and weight. However, some fulfillment companies offer discount rates when orders contain multiple items, whereas others may actually add an additional fee. Therefore, retailers need to doublecheck how these fees change for consolidated shipments.Shipment fees cover the amount it costs to ship an item from the fulfillment center to the customer. Sometimes the fulfillment center handles the final delivery, while some retailers prefer to use a separate carrier.Kitting fees only apply to items with several components that require assembly before shipment. These fines are sometimes also applied when assembled products are returned and need to be broken down. Return costs are only applicable to customer returns that are damaged or defective. The fees supplement the acceptance and processing of returned products, including handling, assembly, and inspection. Account management fees are added to the monthly invoice to cover administrative costs, such as office supplies and handling customer support inquiries.Calculating fulfillment costs is tricky as there is no one-size-fits-all formula that works for every company. Instead, businesses need to total all of their fees from each supplier to get an exact figure. As a safety measure, organizations that estimate their fulfillment expenses should set aside at least 10% more funds to ensure they can cover financial obligations. To calculate fulfillment costs, businesses must first determine the- Fulfillment providers' rates (per unit, product, or timeframe) Number of pallets, orders, and product units for the accounting period After all of the values are defined, they are added to determine the total fulfillment expense for that accounting cycle. However, this figure is only as accurate as the estimated values. Therefore, companies should have a solution that records each cost. For example, a retailer sells assembled tables, and their fulfillment center charges them $3 per unit for storage $2 per unit for picking and packing $2 per unit for kitting fee $5 per unit for shipping $2 per unit for intake fees $30 monthly for administration fees $9 per unit for returns $40 for a one-time setup fee For the first quarter, the business sold 330 tables and had four customer returns, meaning their total fulfillment cost for the first four months was $4,816: 330 tables x $3 = $990 for storage 330 tables x $2= $660 for picking and packing 330 tables x $2 = $660 for kitting 330 tables x $5 = $1,650 for shipping 330 tables x $2 = $660 for intake 4 months x $30 = $120 for administration 4 returns x $9 = $36 for returns $990+$660+$660+$1650+$660+$120+$36+$40=$4,816 It is important to note that as long as the business reduced their customer returns and maintained their sales, their fulfillment cost would decrease as the set-up fee is not recurring.

page_content = How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs fulfillment cost per Fulfillment costs are accounting values that measure how much resources a warehouse or fulfillment center uses while receiving, storing, maintaining, and picking inventory. What are Fulfillment Costs? fees fulfillment The Breakdown of Fulfillment Costs fulfillment pick Setup Fees Intake Fees Storage Fees Pick and Pack Fees Shipping Fees Kitting Fees Return Fees Account Management Fees How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs Regardless of whether a business uses in-house or third-party fulfillment methods, they must supplement the labor, resources, and materials required to complete customer orders. However, in contrast to popular belief, order fulfillment costs extend further than just packing and shipping products. These expenses often include acceptance, store, and other inventory maintenance fees, which can quickly add up. Therefore, companies should take the time to understand exactly what fulfillment centers can charge. Fulfillment costs refer to the total expense accrued from fulfilling customer orders. Typical fulfillment costs include Receiving inventory Storage Product picking Packing supplies Shipments Processing returns Many businesses only factor in the labor required to fulfill orders. However, this is a very limited scope of the entire fulfillment process. Studies show that companies that only consider labor costs neglect up to 50% of the total fulfillment expense. When calculating fulfillment costs, organizations need to include all overhead, inventory, occupancy, labor, and material expenses to get a holistic view of their finances. While some businesses have in-house fulfillment and others use a third-party, there are several fees that contribute to the total fulfillment cost.Setup fees are usually a one-time expense based on the type of business and average order volume. Some fulfillment centers charge on an order-by-order basis, while others set a flat rate. These prices rise with specialty packaging, storage, and delivery.Intake fees, also referred to as receiving costs, supplement the expense of the systems that accept and process incoming inventory. Typically, intake fees are charged per hour, per item, or per inventory unit, which often varies between each product line. Storage fees also tend to fluctuate based on product size, weight, temperature sensitivity, and any storage requirements. Some stock may require a forklift to move around the warehouse, increasing storage fees. Other items may take up more of the storage unit space than others, also increasing expenses. Therefore, warehouses may charge per pallet or amount of space a business uses on a monthly basis. Pick and pack fees refer to the labor required to retrieve an item from storage and package it for the final delivery. These fees commonly range from $3-$5 per unit, depending on the product's size and weight. However, some fulfillment companies offer discount rates when orders contain multiple items, whereas others may actually add an additional fee. Therefore, retailers need to doublecheck how these fees change for consolidated shipments. Shipment fees cover the amount it costs to ship an item from the fulfillment center to the customer. Sometimes the fulfillment center handles the final delivery, while some retailers prefer to use a separate carrier.Kitting fees only apply to items with several components that require assembly before shipment. These fines are sometimes also applied when assembled products are returned and need to be broken down. Return costs are only applicable to customer returns that are damaged or defective. The fees supplement the acceptance and processing of returned products, including handling, assembly, and inspection. Account management fees are added to the monthly invoice to cover administrative costs, such as office supplies and handling customer support inquiries. Calculating fulfillment costs is tricky as there is no one-size-fits-all formula that works for every company. Instead, businesses need to total all of their fees from each supplier to get an exact figure. As a safety measure, organizations that estimate their fulfillment expenses should set aside at least 10% more funds to ensure they can cover financial obligations. To calculate fulfillment costs, businesses must first determine the- Fulfillment providers' rates (per unit, product, or timeframe) Number of pallets, orders, and product units for the accounting period After all of the values are defined, they are added to determine the total fulfillment expense for that accounting cycle. However, this figure is only as accurate as the estimated values. Therefore, companies should have a solution that records each cost. For example, a retailer sells assembled tables, and their fulfillment center charges them $3 per unit for storage $2 per unit for picking and packing $2 per unit for kitting fee $5 per unit for shipping $2 per unit for intake fees $30 monthly for administration fees $9 per unit for returns $40 for a one-time setup fee For the first quarter, the business sold 330 tables and had four customer returns, meaning their total fulfillment cost for the first four months was $4,816: 330 tables x $3 = $990 for storage 330 tables x $2= $660 for picking and packing 330 tables x $2 = $660 for kitting 330 tables x $5 = $1,650 for shipping 330 tables x $2 = $660 for intake 4 months x $30 = $120 for administration 4 returns x $9 = $36 for returns $990+$660+$660+$1650+$660+$120+$36+$40=$4,816 It is important to note that as long as the business reduced their customer returns and maintained their sales, their fulfillment cost would decrease as the set-up fee is not recurring.

page_content = How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs fulfillment cost per Fulfillment costs are accounting values that measure how much resources a warehouse or fulfillment center uses while receiving, storing, maintaining, and picking inventory. What are Fulfillment Costs? fees fulfillment The Breakdown of Fulfillment Costs fulfillment pick Setup Fees Intake Fees Storage Fees cost per order Pick and Pack Fees Shipping Fees Kitting Fees term storage Return Fees Account Management Fees How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs receiving fee Regardless of whether a business uses in-house or third-party fulfillment methods, they must supplement the labor, resources, and materials required to complete customer orders. However, in contrast to popular belief, order fulfillment costs extend further than just packing and shipping products. These expenses often include acceptance, store, and other inventory maintenance fees, which can quickly add up. Therefore, companies should take the time to understand exactly what fulfillment centers can charge. Fulfillment costs refer to the total expense accrued from fulfilling customer orders. Typical fulfillment costs include Receiving inventory Storage Product picking Packing supplies Shipments Processing returns Many businesses only factor in the labor required to fulfill orders. However, this is a very limited scope of the entire fulfillment process. Studies show that companies that only consider labor costs neglect up to 50% of the total fulfillment expense. When calculating fulfillment costs, organizations need to include all overhead, inventory, occupancy, labor, and material expenses to get a holistic view of their finances. While some businesses have in-house fulfillment and others use a third-party, there are several fees that contribute to the total fulfillment cost.Setup fees are usually a one-time expense based on the type of business and average order volume. Some fulfillment centers charge on an order-by-order basis, while others set a flat rate. These prices rise with specialty packaging, storage, and delivery.Intake fees, also referred to as receiving costs, supplement the expense of the systems that accept and process incoming inventory. Typically, intake fees are charged per hour, per item, or per inventory unit, which often varies between each product line. Storage fees also tend to fluctuate based on product size, weight, temperature sensitivity, and any storage requirements. Some stock may require a forklift to move around the warehouse, increasing storage fees. Other items may take up more of the storage unit space than others, also increasing expenses. Therefore, warehouses may charge per pallet or amount of space a business uses on a monthly basis. Pick and pack fees refer to the labor required to retrieve an item from storage and package it for the final delivery. These fees commonly range from $3-$5 per unit, depending on the product's size and weight. However, some fulfillment companies offer discount rates when orders contain multiple items, whereas others may actually add an additional fee. Therefore, retailers need to doublecheck how these fees change for consolidated shipments. Shipment fees cover the amount it costs to ship an item from the fulfillment center to the customer. Sometimes the fulfillment center handles the final delivery, while some retailers prefer to use a separate carrier.Kitting fees only apply to items with several components that require assembly before shipment. These fines are sometimes also applied when assembled products are returned and need to be broken down. Return costs are only applicable to customer returns that are damaged or defective. The fees supplement the acceptance and processing of returned products, including handling, assembly, and inspection. Account management fees are added to the monthly invoice to cover administrative costs, such as office supplies and handling customer support inquiries. Calculating fulfillment costs is tricky as there is no one-size-fits-all formula that works for every company. Instead, businesses need to total all of their fees from each supplier to get an exact figure. As a safety measure, organizations that estimate their fulfillment expenses should set aside at least 10% more funds to ensure they can cover financial obligations. To calculate fulfillment costs, businesses must first determine the- Fulfillment providers' rates (per unit, product, or timeframe) Number of pallets, orders, and product units for the accounting period After all of the values are defined, they are added to determine the total fulfillment expense for that accounting cycle. However, this figure is only as accurate as the estimated values. Therefore, companies should have a solution that records each cost. For example, a retailer sells assembled tables, and their fulfillment center charges them $3 per unit for storage $2 per unit for picking and packing $2 per unit for kitting fee $5 per unit for shipping $2 per unit for intake fees $30 monthly for administration fees $9 per unit for returns $40 for a one-time setup fee For the first quarter, the business sold 330 tables and had four customer returns, meaning their total fulfillment cost for the first four months was $4,816: 330 tables x $3 = $990 for storage 330 tables x $2= $660 for picking and packing 330 tables x $2 = $660 for kitting 330 tables x $5 = $1,650 for shipping 330 tables x $2 = $660 for intake 4 months x $30 = $120 for administration 4 returns x $9 = $36 for returns $990+$660+$660+$1650+$660+$120+$36+$40=$4,816 It is important to note that as long as the business reduced their customer returns and maintained their sales, their fulfillment cost would decrease as the set-up fee is not recurring.

keyword = Fulfillment Costs
page_content = How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs fulfillment cost per Fulfillment costs are accounting values that measure how much resources a warehouse or fulfillment center uses while receiving, storing, maintaining, and picking inventory. What are Fulfillment Costs? fees fulfillment The Breakdown of Fulfillment Costs fulfillment pick Setup Fees Intake Fees Storage Fees cost per order Pick and Pack Fees Shipping Fees Kitting Fees term storage Return Fees Account Management Fees How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs receiving fee per cubic Regardless of whether a business uses in-house or third-party fulfillment methods, they must supplement the labor, resources, and materials required to complete customer orders. However, in contrast to popular belief, order fulfillment costs extend further than just packing and shipping products. These expenses often include acceptance, store, and other inventory maintenance fees, which can quickly add up. Therefore, companies should take the time to understand exactly what fulfillment centers can charge. Fulfillment costs refer to the total expense accrued from fulfilling customer orders. Typical fulfillment costs include Receiving inventory Storage Product picking Packing supplies Shipments Processing returns Many businesses only factor in the labor required to fulfill orders. However, this is a very limited scope of the entire fulfillment process. Studies show that companies that only consider labor costs neglect up to 50% of the total fulfillment expense. When calculating fulfillment costs, organizations need to include all overhead, inventory, occupancy, labor, and material expenses to get a holistic view of their finances. While some businesses have in-house fulfillment and others use a third-party, there are several fees that contribute to the total fulfillment cost.Setup fees are usually a one-time expense based on the type of business and average order volume. Some fulfillment centers charge on an order-by-order basis, while others set a flat rate. These prices rise with specialty packaging, storage, and delivery.Intake fees, also referred to as receiving costs, supplement the expense of the systems that accept and process incoming inventory. Typically, intake fees are charged per hour, per item, or per inventory unit, which often varies between each product line. Storage fees also tend to fluctuate based on product size, weight, temperature sensitivity, and any storage requirements. Some stock may require a forklift to move around the warehouse, increasing storage fees. Other items may take up more of the storage unit space than others, also increasing expenses. Therefore, warehouses may charge per pallet or amount of space a business uses on a monthly basis. Pick and pack fees refer to the labor required to retrieve an item from storage and package it for the final delivery. These fees commonly range from $3-$5 per unit, depending on the product's size and weight. However, some fulfillment companies offer discount rates when orders contain multiple items, whereas others may actually add an additional fee. Therefore, retailers need to doublecheck how these fees change for consolidated shipments. Shipment fees cover the amount it costs to ship an item from the fulfillment center to the customer. Sometimes the fulfillment center handles the final delivery, while some retailers prefer to use a separate carrier.Kitting fees only apply to items with several components that require assembly before shipment. These fines are sometimes also applied when assembled products are returned and need to be broken down. Return costs are only applicable to customer returns that are damaged or defective. The fees supplement the acceptance and processing of returned products, including handling, assembly, and inspection. Account management fees are added to the monthly invoice to cover administrative costs, such as office supplies and handling customer support inquiries. Calculating fulfillment costs is tricky as there is no one-size-fits-all formula that works for every company. Instead, businesses need to total all of their fees from each supplier to get an exact figure. As a safety measure, organizations that estimate their fulfillment expenses should set aside at least 10% more funds to ensure they can cover financial obligations. To calculate fulfillment costs, businesses must first determine the- Fulfillment providers' rates (per unit, product, or timeframe) Number of pallets, orders, and product units for the accounting period After all of the values are defined, they are added to determine the total fulfillment expense for that accounting cycle. However, this figure is only as accurate as the estimated values. Therefore, companies should have a solution that records each cost. For example, a retailer sells assembled tables, and their fulfillment center charges them $3 per unit for storage $2 per unit for picking and packing $2 per unit for kitting fee $5 per unit for shipping $2 per unit for intake fees $30 monthly for administration fees $9 per unit for returns $40 for a one-time setup fee For the first quarter, the business sold 330 tables and had four customer returns, meaning their total fulfillment cost for the first four months was $4,816: 330 tables x $3 = $990 for storage 330 tables x $2= $660 for picking and packing 330 tables x $2 = $660 for kitting 330 tables x $5 = $1,650 for shipping 330 tables x $2 = $660 for intake 4 months x $30 = $120 for administration 4 returns x $9 = $36 for returns $990+$660+$660+$1650+$660+$120+$36+$40=$4,816 It is important to note that as long as the business reduced their customer returns and maintained their sales, their fulfillment cost would decrease as the set-up fee is not recurring.

page_content = How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs fulfillment cost per Fulfillment costs are accounting values that measure how much resources a warehouse or fulfillment center uses while receiving, storing, maintaining, and picking inventory. What are Fulfillment Costs? fees fulfillment The Breakdown of Fulfillment Costs fulfillment pick Setup Fees Intake Fees Storage Fees cost per order Pick and Pack Fees Shipping Fees pallet per Kitting Fees term storage Return Fees Account Management Fees How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs receiving fee per cubic Regardless of whether a business uses in-house or third-party fulfillment methods, they must supplement the labor, resources, and materials required to complete customer orders. However, in contrast to popular belief, order fulfillment costs extend further than just packing and shipping products. These expenses often include acceptance, store, and other inventory maintenance fees, which can quickly add up. Therefore, companies should take the time to understand exactly what fulfillment centers can charge. Fulfillment costs refer to the total expense accrued from fulfilling customer orders. Typical fulfillment costs include Receiving inventory Storage Product picking Packing supplies Shipments Processing returns Many businesses only factor in the labor required to fulfill orders. However, this is a very limited scope of the entire fulfillment process. Studies show that companies that only consider labor costs neglect up to 50% of the total fulfillment expense. When calculating fulfillment costs, organizations need to include all overhead, inventory, occupancy, labor, and material expenses to get a holistic view of their finances. While some businesses have in-house fulfillment and others use a third-party, there are several fees that contribute to the total fulfillment cost.Setup fees are usually a one-time expense based on the type of business and average order volume. Some fulfillment centers charge on an order-by-order basis, while others set a flat rate. These prices rise with specialty packaging, storage, and delivery.Intake fees, also referred to as receiving costs, supplement the expense of the systems that accept and process incoming inventory. Typically, intake fees are charged per hour, per item, or per inventory unit, which often varies between each product line. Storage fees also tend to fluctuate based on product size, weight, temperature sensitivity, and any storage requirements. Some stock may require a forklift to move around the warehouse, increasing storage fees. Other items may take up more of the storage unit space than others, also increasing expenses. Therefore, warehouses may charge per pallet or amount of space a business uses on a monthly basis. Pick and pack fees refer to the labor required to retrieve an item from storage and package it for the final delivery. These fees commonly range from $3-$5 per unit, depending on the product's size and weight. However, some fulfillment companies offer discount rates when orders contain multiple items, whereas others may actually add an additional fee. Therefore, retailers need to doublecheck how these fees change for consolidated shipments. Shipment fees cover the amount it costs to ship an item from the fulfillment center to the customer. Sometimes the fulfillment center handles the final delivery, while some retailers prefer to use a separate carrier.Kitting fees only apply to items with several components that require assembly before shipment. These fines are sometimes also applied when assembled products are returned and need to be broken down. Return costs are only applicable to customer returns that are damaged or defective. The fees supplement the acceptance and processing of returned products, including handling, assembly, and inspection. Account management fees are added to the monthly invoice to cover administrative costs, such as office supplies and handling customer support inquiries. Calculating fulfillment costs is tricky as there is no one-size-fits-all formula that works for every company. Instead, businesses need to total all of their fees from each supplier to get an exact figure. As a safety measure, organizations that estimate their fulfillment expenses should set aside at least 10% more funds to ensure they can cover financial obligations. To calculate fulfillment costs, businesses must first determine the- Fulfillment providers' rates (per unit, product, or timeframe) Number of pallets, orders, and product units for the accounting period After all of the values are defined, they are added to determine the total fulfillment expense for that accounting cycle. However, this figure is only as accurate as the estimated values. Therefore, companies should have a solution that records each cost. For example, a retailer sells assembled tables, and their fulfillment center charges them $3 per unit for storage $2 per unit for picking and packing $2 per unit for kitting fee $5 per unit for shipping $2 per unit for intake fees $30 monthly for administration fees $9 per unit for returns $40 for a one-time setup fee For the first quarter, the business sold 330 tables and had four customer returns, meaning their total fulfillment cost for the first four months was $4,816: 330 tables x $3 = $990 for storage 330 tables x $2= $660 for picking and packing 330 tables x $2 = $660 for kitting 330 tables x $5 = $1,650 for shipping 330 tables x $2 = $660 for intake 4 months x $30 = $120 for administration 4 returns x $9 = $36 for returns $990+$660+$660+$1650+$660+$120+$36+$40=$4,816 It is important to note that as long as the business reduced their customer returns and maintained their sales, their fulfillment cost would decrease as the set-up fee is not recurring.

Identification Business planning process Note: 2. Formulation Business planning process 3. Deligation 4. Execution Business planning process Tip: Business planning is defined as the process of identifying an organization’s strategies, objectives, and projected actions in order to optimize development and success over a specific time frame. Proper business planning is absolutely crucial to an organization’s success and overall bottom line profitability. In order for a business planning process to optimally benefit an organization, it must be both realistic and achievable. For this reason, some experts actually define the business planning process as a management function that involves the steps, design, and quantified resources necessary in order to achieve the optimized balance between demands and needs utilizing available resources. One study shows that the average entrepreneur business owner dedicates around 68% of time spent working in their business on daily tasks and addressing short term issues. The same study shows that only around 32% of the time a business owner spends at work is dedicated to strategic planning and long term goals. Clearly, there is a pressing need for both small business owners and business management professionals at larger corporations to focus on the business planning process. Before starting business planning processes, professionals must make sure they properly understand them. Most human resource and business management professionals agree that there are 4 basic steps within the business planning process. The 4 main steps in the business planning process include: The first of the planning process steps is the identification of objectives and business goals to be accomplished. Business goals may be either short term or long term in nature. In fact, many organizations list many different short term and long term goals during this step. Identifying business goals and objectives to accomplish is necessary in order to actually achieve goals at an organization. Additionally, well established business goals help business management team professionals and human resource staff members to better perform their roles. Alternatively, without the establishment of well defined business objectives, anything from marketing strategy to customer service oriented goals would not be achievable. The best business goals and objectives will follow the SMART goal acronym which stands for specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. These SMART business goals and objectives will help business owners and their employees create and maintain a competitive advantage in the industry. Securing a competitive advantage will likely result in a larger market share and cash flow increases. Business goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely will help business owners and their staff members to create and sustain a competitive advantage within their industry. After short term and long term business goals are established, the next process steps can be undertaken. The second of the planning process steps is the formulation of strategies in order to achieve set business goals and objectives. Creating action steps and developing techniques for specific business goals will help business professionals to achieve previously set objectives. Best practices for this step of the planning process include the involvement of team members. Team members can contribute invaluable advice and insights as a result of their first hand experience and knowledge. Additionally, team members can help business leaders better understand if any portions of business goals are unrealistic or unachievable. Once the business strategy and business goals are understood, the management team and other involved parties can move on to the next step. The third of the planning process steps is the designation of employees to roles and tasks. It is crucial that individual team members understand their responsibilities comprehensively. For this reason, best practices suggest that business management professionals make sure to ask team members if they have any questions regarding their role in the business planning process. One important consideration during this process step is for the management team to make sure they are establishing realistic time frames for tasks delegated. Providing too much time or too little time can result in devastating business planning consequences. If supplied with too much time to accomplish delegated responsibilities, employees may procrastinate. On the other hand, if supplied with not enough time, employees may become demoralized about the possibility to achieve goals and give up. The last of the planning process steps is the implementation, direction, and monitoring of business planning action items. The management team should not be content with team members merely understanding their role but must also actively monitor employee task progression. Best practices recommend consistent follow ups between management team professionals and employees in regards to their progress. Consistent follow ups can not only increase employee morale but also helps to identify issues early on. For example, if an employee needs additional resources to complete their tasks, the management team and human resource department can immediately address that issue. Alternatively, the human resource department and business management professionals may have not learned of the issue until even more significant issues developed. Business management professionals and human resource department team members should make sure that employees are supplied with the proper tools in order to complete their designated tasks.

keyword = Fulfillment Costs
page_content = How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs fulfillment cost per Fulfillment costs are accounting values that measure how much resources a warehouse or fulfillment center uses while receiving, storing, maintaining, and picking inventory. What are Fulfillment Costs? fees fulfillment The Breakdown of Fulfillment Costs fulfillment pick Setup Fees Intake Fees Storage Fees cost per order Pick and Pack Fees Shipping Fees pallet per Kitting Fees term storage Return Fees Account Management Fees How to Calculate Fulfillment Costs cubic foot per cubic Regardless of whether a business uses in-house or third-party fulfillment methods, they must supplement the labor, resources, and materials required to complete customer orders. However, in contrast to popular belief, order fulfillment costs extend further than just packing and shipping products. These expenses often include acceptance, store, and other inventory maintenance fees, which can quickly add up. Therefore, companies should take the time to understand exactly what fulfillment centers can charge. Fulfillment costs refer to the total expense accrued from fulfilling customer orders. Typical fulfillment costs include Receiving inventory Storage Product picking Packing supplies Shipments Processing returns Many businesses only factor in the labor required to fulfill orders. However, this is a very limited scope of the entire fulfillment process. Studies show that companies that only consider labor costs neglect up to 50% of the total fulfillment expense. When calculating fulfillment costs, organizations need to include all overhead, inventory, occupancy, labor, and material expenses to get a holistic view of their finances. While some businesses have in-house fulfillment and others use a third-party, there are several fees that contribute to the total fulfillment cost.Setup fees are usually a one-time expense based on the type of business and average order volume. Some fulfillment centers charge on an order-by-order basis, while others set a flat rate. These prices rise with specialty packaging, storage, and delivery.Intake costs, also referred to as receiving fee, supplement the expense of the systems that accept and process incoming inventory. Typically, intake fees are charged per hour, per item, or per inventory unit, which often varies between each product line. Storage fees also tend to fluctuate based on product size, weight, temperature sensitivity, and any storage requirements. Some stock may require a forklift to move around the warehouse, increasing storage fees. Other items may take up more of the storage unit space than others, also increasing expenses. Therefore, warehouses may charge per pallet or amount of space a business uses on a monthly basis. Pick and pack fees refer to the labor required to retrieve an item from storage and package it for the final delivery. These fees commonly range from $3-$5 per unit, depending on the product's size and weight. However, some fulfillment companies offer discount rates when orders contain multiple items, whereas others may actually add an additional fee. Therefore, retailers need to doublecheck how these fees change for consolidated shipments. Shipment fees cover the amount it costs to ship an item from the fulfillment center to the customer. Sometimes the fulfillment center handles the final delivery, while some retailers prefer to use a separate carrier.Kitting fees only apply to items with several components that require assembly before shipment. These fines are sometimes also applied when assembled products are returned and need to be broken down. Return costs are only applicable to customer returns that are damaged or defective. The fees supplement the acceptance and processing of returned products, including handling, assembly, and inspection. Account management fees are added to the monthly invoice to cover administrative costs, such as office supplies and handling customer support inquiries. Calculating fulfillment costs is tricky as there is no one-size-fits-all formula that works for every company. Instead, businesses need to total all of their fees from each supplier to get an exact figure. As a safety measure, organizations that estimate their fulfillment expenses should set aside at least 10% more funds to ensure they can cover financial obligations. To calculate fulfillment costs, businesses must first determine the- Fulfillment providers' rates (per unit, product, or timeframe) Number of pallets, orders, and product units for the accounting period After all of the values are defined, they are added to determine the total fulfillment expense for that accounting cycle. However, this figure is only as accurate as the estimated values. Therefore, companies should have a solution that records each cost. For example, a retailer sells assembled tables, and their fulfillment center charges them $3 per unit for storage $2 per unit for picking and packing $2 per unit for kitting fee $5 per unit for shipping $2 per unit for intake fees $30 monthly for administration fees $9 per unit for returns $40 for a one-time setup fee For the first quarter, the business sold 330 tables and had four customer returns, meaning their total fulfillment cost for the first four months was $4,816: 330 tables x $3 = $990 for storage 330 tables x $2= $660 for picking and packing 330 tables x $2 = $660 for kitting 330 tables x $5 = $1,650 for shipping 330 tables x $2 = $660 for intake 4 months x $30 = $120 for administration 4 returns x $9 = $36 for returns $990+$660+$660+$1650+$660+$120+$36+$40=$4,816 It is important to note that as long as the business reduced their customer returns and maintained their sales, their fulfillment cost would decrease as the set-up fee is not recurring.

Identification Business planning process Note: 2. Formulation Business planning process 3. Deligation 4. Execution Business planning process Tip: Key Takeaways Business planning is defined as the process of identifying an organization's strategies, objectives, and projected actions in order to optimize development and success over a specific time frame. Proper business planning is absolutely crucial to an organization's success and overall bottom line profitability. In order for a business planning process to optimally benefit an organization, it must be both realistic and achievable. For this reason, some experts actually define the business planning process as a management function that involves the steps, design, and quantified resources necessary in order to achieve the optimized balance between demands and needs utilizing available resources. One study shows that the average entrepreneur business owner dedicates around 68% of time spent working in their business on daily tasks and addressing short term issues. The same study shows that only around 32% of the time a business owner spends at work is dedicated to strategic planning and long term goals. Clearly, there is a pressing need for both small business owners and business management professionals at larger corporations to focus on the business planning process. Before starting business planning processes, professionals must make sure they properly understand them. Most human resource and business management professionals agree that there are 4 basic steps within the business planning process. The 4 main steps in the business planning process include:The first of the planning process steps is the identification of objectives and business goals to be accomplished. Business goals may be either short term or long term in nature. In fact, many organizations list many different short term and long term goals during this step. Identifying business goals and objectives to accomplish is necessary in order to actually achieve goals at an organization. Additionally, well established business goals help business management team professionals and human resource staff members to better perform their roles. Alternatively, without the establishment of well defined business objectives, anything from marketing strategy to customer service oriented goals would not be achievable. The best business goals and objectives will follow the SMART goal acronym which stands for specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. These SMART business goals and objectives will help business owners and their employees create and maintain a competitive advantage in the industry. Securing a competitive advantage will likely result in a larger market share and cash flow increases. Business goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely will help business owners and their staff members to create and sustain a competitive advantage within their industry. After short term and long term business goals are established, the next process steps can be undertaken. The second of the planning process steps is the formulation of strategies in order to achieve set business goals and objectives. Creating action steps and developing techniques for specific business goals will help business professionals to achieve previously set objectives. Best practices for this step of the planning process include the involvement of team members. Team members can contribute invaluable advice and insights as a result of their first hand experience and knowledge. Additionally, team members can help business leaders better understand if any portions of business goals are unrealistic or unachievable.Once the business strategy and business goals are understood, the management team and other involved parties can move on to the next step. The third of the planning process steps is the designation of employees to roles and tasks. It is crucial that individual team members understand their responsibilities comprehensively. For this reason, best practices suggest that business management professionals make sure to ask team members if they have any questions regarding their role in the business planning process. One important consideration during this process step is for the management team to make sure they are establishing realistic time frames for tasks delegated. Providing too much time or too little time can result in devastating business planning consequences. If supplied with too much time to accomplish delegated responsibilities, employees may procrastinate. On the other hand, if supplied with not enough time, employees may become demoralized about the possibility to achieve goals and give up.The last of the planning process steps is the implementation, direction, and monitoring of business planning action items. The management team should not be content with team members merely understanding their role but must also actively monitor employee task progression. Best practices recommend consistent follow ups between management team professionals and employees in regards to their progress. Consistent follow ups can not only increase employee morale but also helps to identify issues early on. For example, if an employee needs additional resources to complete their tasks, the management team and human resource department can immediately address that issue. Alternatively, the human resource department and business management professionals may have not learned of the issue until even more significant issues developed. Business management professionals and human resource department team members should make sure that employees are supplied with the proper tools in order to complete their designated tasks. Business planning consists of 4 main steps: identification, formulation, designation, and execution. Tools helpful for the business planning process include SMART goals and SWOT analysis techniques.

page_content = 8 Effective Lead Time Reduction Strategies to Implement Lead time reduction eliminates unnecessary, time-consuming, and inefficient operations that elongate any part of the order fulfillment process, from production to shipping. What is Lead Time? 8 Lead Time Reduction Strategies Consolidate Suppliers Create Incentives Order Inventory Frequently Share Sales Data with Suppliers Automate Inventory Management Use a Domestic Supplier Use Standard Components Consider Kitting Services Retailers are only able to provide their customers with the service that they receive from suppliers. Therefore, if vendors delay inventory shipments, businesses are unable to fulfill their customers’ orders on time. By practicing lead time reduction, companies can minimize their wait time for inventory orders to meet customer demand consistently. Lead time refers to how long it takes a business to process and complete an order. In other words, lead time is the amount of time it takes a customer or company to receive their order. This starts when the order is placed and ends once the package reaches its final destination, whether that is another business or the consumer. For example, if a business places a product order with their supplier and receives their shipment 10 days later, the lead time for that specific item is 10 days. However, lead times often vary between different vendors and types of inventory. For retailers, the lead time is an essential tool for calculating reorder points and safety stock to ensure they always have enough products to meet customer demand. Reorder points trigger inventory orders once stock levels dip below a healthy level. When calculated correctly, reorders buy the company enough time until they receive their shipments. Even with demand forecasting, companies may experience unexpected spikes in demand due to passing fads. In these situations, it is vital for businesses to have additional stock, or safety stock, to fulfill customer orders while more inventory is ordered. This prevents stockouts and backorders. Otherwise, stockouts could lead to unsatisfied customers that seek out their desired products elsewhere. Now more than ever, consumers expect to have their orders as soon as possible. This means that retailers also need to receive their inventory quickly. The longer businesses make their customers wait, the more likely they are to leave. Aside from creating impatient customers, extended lead times can also cost companies significant capital, from lost sales, inflated inventory costs, and expedited shipping. Therefore, organizations should consider the different methods of lead time reduction. Handling multiple suppliers sometimes has more cons than pros, as businesses tend to overlook lead times and make logistical mistakes. This can significantly elongate wait times for customers. Instead, companies should limit their backup suppliers to one or two, and consolidate other vendors. Sometimes vendors provide similar inventory for competitors within the same market, making it difficult for either business to gain a competitive edge. However, companies can incentivize reduced lead times by offering bonuses for every early delivery. This encourages the vendor to prioritize the business's shipments over other clients, giving them the first chance at new product shipments. Many businesses purchase their inventory in bulk to receive wholesale or discounted prices, thinking it is saving money. However, buying in bulk sometimes elongates lead times, costing the company potential sales and new customers. Depending on the lead time duration, this could actually cost the organization more than they are saving. Instead, businesses should perform a total cost analysis to determine if ordering smaller batches at higher frequencies minimizes labor and carrying costs, as well as lead times. Companies can reference previous sales data to predict their future inventory needs. Demand forecasts give businesses the chance to alert their suppliers ahead of time to avoid late deliveries. Vendors can set the order aside until they receive the alert to make the shipment. Relying on manual data consolidation often means that companies do not realize that they are understocked until it is too late. With automated inventory ordering software, businesses have access to real-time inventory data and are immediately alerted with levels that are dangerously low. Advanced ordering solutions can even be programmed to automatically submit a purchase order when products hit their reorder points to prevent stockouts. By switching to a domestic supplier, companies significantly reduce their lead times by up to several weeks, depending on the type of inventory. This way, businesses do not have to worry about delays regarding customs and international regulations. Customized components have significantly longer lead times as each product requires special attention. If businesses are able, they should switch to standard components that can be shipped in bulk and supplied quickly. Standard components also require less funding for engineering, production, and labor, making them cost-effective. However, companies that require customized components should use experts in their field that work efficiently, rather than startups that are still learning. Kitting refers to assembling products that have multiple parts. Businesses that establish kitting processes are able to group parts that are frequently used together to reduce lead times. Creating already assembled batches also improves efficiency, productivity, and order fulfillment accuracy, as employees do not have to dedicate time picking individual components.

page_content = 8 Effective Lead Time Reduction Strategies to Implement Lead time reduction eliminates unnecessary, time-consuming, and inefficient operations that elongate any part of the order fulfillment process, from production to shipping. What is Lead Time? 8 Lead Time Reduction Strategies Consolidate Suppliers Create Incentives Order Inventory Frequently Share Sales Data with Suppliers Automate Inventory Management Use a Domestic Supplier Use Standard Components Consider Kitting Services Retailers are only able to provide their customers with the service that they receive from suppliers. Therefore, if vendors delay inventory shipments, businesses are unable to fulfill their customers’ orders on time. By practicing lead time reduction, companies can minimize their wait time for inventory orders to meet customer demand consistently. Lead time refers to how long it takes a business to process and complete an order. In other words, lead time is the amount of time it takes a customer or company to receive their order. This starts when the order is placed and ends once the package reaches its final destination, whether that is another business or the consumer. For example, if a business places a product order with their supplier and receives their shipment 10 days later, the lead time for that specific item is 10 days. However, lead times often vary between different vendors and types of inventory. For retailers, the lead time is an essential tool for calculating reorder points and safety stock to ensure they always have enough products to meet customer demand. Reorder points trigger inventory orders once stock levels dip below a healthy level. When calculated correctly, reorders buy the company enough time until they receive their shipments. Even with demand forecasting, companies may experience unexpected spikes in demand due to passing fads. In these situations, it is vital for businesses to have additional stock, or safety stock, to fulfill customer orders while more inventory is ordered. This prevents stockouts and backorders. Otherwise, stockouts could lead to unsatisfied customers that seek out their desired products elsewhere. Now more than ever, consumers expect to have their orders as soon as possible. This means that retailers also need to receive their inventory quickly. The longer businesses make their customers wait, the more likely they are to leave. Aside from creating impatient customers, extended lead times can also cost companies significant capital, from lost sales, inflated inventory costs, and expedited shipping. Therefore, organizations should consider the different methods of lead time reduction. Handling multiple suppliers sometimes has more cons than pros, as businesses tend to overlook lead times and make logistical mistakes. This can significantly elongate wait times for customers. Instead, companies should limit their backup suppliers to one or two, and consolidate other vendors. Sometimes vendors provide similar inventory for competitors within the same market, making it difficult for either business to gain a competitive edge. However, companies can incentivize reduced lead times by offering bonuses for every early delivery. This encourages the vendor to prioritize the business's shipments over other clients, giving them the first chance at new product shipments. Many businesses purchase their inventory in bulk to receive wholesale or discounted prices, thinking it is saving money. However, buying in bulk sometimes elongates lead times, costing the company potential sales and new customers. Depending on the lead time duration, this could actually cost the organization more than they are saving. Instead, businesses should perform a total cost analysis to determine if ordering smaller batches at higher frequencies minimizes labor and carrying costs, as well as lead times. Companies can reference previous sales data to predict their future inventory needs. Demand forecasts give businesses the chance to alert their suppliers ahead of time to avoid late deliveries. Vendors can set the order aside until they receive the alert to make the shipment. Relying on manual data consolidation often means that companies do not realize that they are understocked until it is too late. With automated inventory ordering software, businesses have access to real-time inventory data and are immediately alerted with levels that are dangerously low. Advanced ordering solutions can even be programmed to automatically submit a purchase order when products hit their reorder points to prevent stockouts. By switching to a domestic supplier, companies significantly reduce their lead times by up to several weeks, depending on the type of inventory. This way, businesses do not have to worry about delays regarding customs and international regulations. Customized components have significantly longer lead times as each product requires special attention. If businesses are able, they should switch to standard components that can be shipped in bulk and supplied quickly. Standard components also require less funding for engineering, production, and labor, making them cost-effective. However, companies that require customized components should use experts in their field that work efficiently, rather than startups that are still learning. Kitting refers to assembling products that have multiple parts. Businesses that establish kitting processes are able to group parts that are frequently used together to reduce lead times. Creating already assembled batches also improves efficiency, productivity, and order fulfillment accuracy, as employees do not have to dedicate time picking individual components.

page_content = 8 Effective Lead Time Reduction Strategies to Implement reorder point safety stock Lead time reduction eliminates unnecessary, time-consuming, and inefficient operations that elongate any part of the order fulfillment process, from production to shipping. What is Lead Time? 8 Lead Time Reduction Strategies Consolidate Suppliers Create Incentives Order Inventory Frequently Share Sales Data with Suppliers Automate Inventory Management Use a Domestic Supplier Use Standard Components Consider Kitting Services Retailers are only able to provide their customers with the service that they receive from suppliers. Therefore, if vendors delay inventory shipments, businesses are unable to fulfill their customers’ orders on time. By practicing lead time reduction, companies can minimize their wait time for inventory orders to meet customer demand consistently. Lead time refers to how long it takes a business to process and complete an order. In other words, lead time is the amount of time it takes a customer or company to receive their order. This starts when the order is placed and ends once the package reaches its final destination, whether that is another business or the consumer. For example, if a business places a product order with their supplier and receives their shipment 10 days later, the lead time for that specific item is 10 days. However, lead times often vary between different vendors and types of inventory. For retailers, the lead time is an essential tool for calculating reorder points and safety stock to ensure they always have enough products to meet customer demand. Reorder points trigger inventory orders once stock levels dip below a healthy level. When calculated correctly, reorders buy the company enough time until they receive their shipments. Even with demand forecasting, companies may experience unexpected spikes in demand due to passing fads. In these situations, it is vital for businesses to have additional stock, or safety stock, to fulfill customer orders while more inventory is ordered. This prevents stockouts and backorders. Otherwise, stockouts could lead to unsatisfied customers that seek out their desired products elsewhere. Now more than ever, consumers expect to have their orders as soon as possible. This means that retailers also need to receive their inventory quickly. The longer businesses make their customers wait, the more likely they are to leave. Aside from creating impatient customers, extended lead times can also cost companies significant capital, from lost sales, inflated inventory costs, and expedited shipping. Therefore, organizations should consider the different methods of lead time reduction. Handling multiple suppliers sometimes has more cons than pros, as businesses tend to overlook lead times and make logistical mistakes. This can significantly elongate wait times for customers. Instead, companies should limit their backup suppliers to one or two, and consolidate other vendors. Sometimes vendors provide similar inventory for competitors within the same market, making it difficult for either business to gain a competitive edge. However, companies can incentivize reduced lead times by offering bonuses for every early delivery. This encourages the vendor to prioritize the business's shipments over other clients, giving them the first chance at new product shipments. Many businesses purchase their inventory in bulk to receive wholesale or discounted prices, thinking it is saving money. However, buying in bulk sometimes elongates lead times, costing the company potential sales and new customers. Depending on the lead time duration, this could actually cost the organization more than they are saving. Instead, businesses should perform a total cost analysis to determine if ordering smaller batches at higher frequencies minimizes labor and carrying costs, as well as lead times. Companies can reference previous sales data to predict their future inventory needs. Demand forecasts give businesses the chance to alert their suppliers ahead of time to avoid late deliveries. Vendors can set the order aside until they receive the alert to make the shipment. Relying on manual data consolidation often means that companies do not realize that they are understocked until it is too late. With automated inventory ordering software, businesses have access to real-time inventory data and are immediately alerted with levels that are dangerously low. Advanced ordering solutions can even be programmed to automatically submit a purchase order when products hit their reorder points to prevent stockouts. By switching to a domestic supplier, companies significantly reduce their lead times by up to several weeks, depending on the type of inventory. This way, businesses do not have to worry about delays regarding customs and international regulations. Customized components have significantly longer lead times as each product requires special attention. If businesses are able, they should switch to standard components that can be shipped in bulk and supplied quickly. Standard components also require less funding for engineering, production, and labor, making them cost-effective. However, companies that require customized components should use experts in their field that work efficiently, rather than startups that are still learning. Kitting refers to assembling products that have multiple parts. Businesses that establish kitting processes are able to group parts that are frequently used together to reduce lead times. Creating already assembled batches also improves efficiency, productivity, and order fulfillment accuracy, as employees do not have to dedicate time picking individual components.

page_content = 8 Effective Lead Time Reduction Strategies to Implement reorder point safety stock Lead time reduction eliminates unnecessary, time-consuming, and inefficient operations that elongate any part of the order fulfillment process, from production to shipping. What is Lead Time? 8 Lead Time Reduction Strategies Consolidate Suppliers Create Incentives Order Inventory Frequently Share Sales Data with Suppliers Automate Inventory Management Use a Domestic Supplier Use Standard Components Consider Kitting Services Retailers are only able to provide their customers with the service that they receive from suppliers. Therefore, if vendors delay inventory shipments, businesses are unable to fulfill their customers' orders on time. By practicing lead time reduction, companies can minimize their wait time for inventory orders to meet customer demand consistently. Lead time refers to how long it takes a business to process and complete an order. In other words, lead time is the amount of time it takes a customer or company to receive their order. This starts when the order is placed and ends once the package reaches its final destination, whether that is another business or the consumer. For example, if a business places a product order with their supplier and receives their shipment 10 days later, the lead time for that specific item is 10 days. However, lead times often vary between different vendors and types of inventory. For retailers, the lead time is an essential tool for calculating reorder points and safety stock to ensure they always have enough products to meet customer demand. Reorder points trigger inventory orders once stock levels dip below a healthy level. When calculated correctly, reorders buy the company enough time until they receive their shipments. Even with demand forecasting, companies may experience unexpected spikes in demand due to passing fads. In these situations, it is vital for businesses to have additional stock, or safety stock, to fulfill customer orders while more inventory is ordered. This prevents stockouts and backorders. Otherwise, stockouts could lead to unsatisfied customers that seek out their desired products elsewhere. Now more than ever, consumers expect to have their orders as soon as possible. This means that retailers also need to receive their inventory quickly. The longer businesses make their customers wait, the more likely they are to leave. Aside from creating impatient customers, extended lead times can also cost companies significant capital, from lost sales, inflated inventory costs, and expedited shipping. Therefore, organizations should consider the different methods of lead time reduction. Handling multiple suppliers sometimes has more cons than pros, as businesses tend to overlook lead times and make logistical mistakes. This can significantly elongate wait times for customers. Instead, companies should limit their backup suppliers to one or two, and consolidate other vendors. Sometimes vendors provide similar inventory for competitors within the same market, making it difficult for either business to gain a competitive edge. However, companies can incentivize reduced lead times by offering bonuses for every early delivery. This encourages the vendor to prioritize the business's shipments over other clients, giving them the first chance at new product shipments. Many businesses purchase their inventory in bulk to receive wholesale or discounted prices, thinking it is saving money. However, buying in bulk sometimes elongates lead times, costing the company potential sales and new customers. Depending on the lead time duration, this could actually cost the organization more than they are saving. Instead, businesses should perform a total cost analysis to determine if ordering smaller batches at higher frequencies minimizes labor and carrying costs, as well as lead times. Companies can reference previous sales data to predict their future inventory needs. Demand forecasts give businesses the chance to alert their suppliers ahead of time to avoid late deliveries. Vendors can set the order aside until they receive the alert to make the shipment. Relying on manual data consolidation often means that companies do not realize that they are understocked until it is too late. With automated inventory ordering software, businesses have access to real-time inventory data and are immediately alerted with levels that are dangerously low. Advanced ordering solutions can even be programmed to automatically submit a purchase order when products hit their reorder points to prevent stockouts. By switching to a domestic supplier, companies significantly reduce their lead times by up to several weeks, depending on the type of inventory. This way, businesses do not have to worry about delays regarding customs and international regulations. Customized components have significantly longer lead times as each product requires special attention. If businesses are able, they should switch to standard components that can be shipped in bulk and supplied quickly. Standard components also require less funding for engineering, production, and labor, making them cost-effective. However, companies that require customized components should use experts in their field that work efficiently, rather than startups that are still learning. Kitting refers to assembling products that have multiple parts. Businesses that establish kitting processes are able to group parts that are frequently used together to reduce lead times. Creating already assembled batches also improves efficiency, productivity, and order fulfillment accuracy, as employees do not have to dedicate time picking individual components.

page_content = 8 Effective Lead Time Reduction Strategies to Implement reorder point safety stock Lead time reduction eliminates unnecessary, time-consuming, and inefficient operations that elongate any part of the order fulfillment process, from production to shipping. What is Lead Time? safety stock reorder point 8 Lead Time Reduction Strategies safety stock safety stock Consolidate Suppliers Create Incentives Order Inventory Frequently daily usage average Share Sales Data with Suppliers Automate Inventory Management Use a Domestic Supplier Use Standard Components Consider Kitting Services Retailers are only able to provide their customers with the service that they receive from suppliers. Therefore, if vendors delay inventory shipments, businesses are unable to fulfill their customers' orders on time. By practicing lead time reduction, companies can minimize their wait time for inventory orders to meet customer demand consistently. Lead time refers to how long it takes a business to process and complete an order. In other words, lead time is the amount of time it takes a customer or company to receive their order. This starts when the order is placed and ends once the package reaches its final destination, whether that is another business or the consumer. For example, if a business places a product order with their supplier and receives their shipment 10 days later, the lead time for that specific item is 10 days. However, lead times often vary between different vendors and types of inventory. For retailers, the lead time is an essential tool for calculating reorder points and safety stock to ensure they always have enough products to meet customer demand. Reorder points trigger inventory orders once stock levels dip below a healthy level. When calculated correctly, reorders buy the company enough time until they receive their shipments. Even with demand forecasting, companies may experience unexpected spikes in demand due to passing fads. In these situations, it is vital for businesses to have additional stock, or safety stock, to fulfill customer orders while more inventory is ordered. This prevents stockouts and backorders. Otherwise, stockouts could lead to unsatisfied customers that seek out their desired products elsewhere. Now more than ever, consumers expect to have their orders as soon as possible. This means that retailers also need to receive their inventory quickly. The longer businesses make their customers wait, the more likely they are to leave. Aside from creating impatient customers, extended lead times can also cost companies significant capital, from lost sales, inflated inventory costs, and expedited shipping. Therefore, organizations should consider the different methods of lead time reduction. Handling multiple suppliers sometimes has more cons than pros, as businesses tend to overlook lead times and make logistical mistakes. This can significantly elongate wait times for customers. Instead, companies should limit their backup suppliers to one or two, and consolidate other vendors. Sometimes vendors provide similar inventory for competitors within the same market, making it difficult for either business to gain a competitive edge. However, companies can incentivize reduced lead times by offering bonuses for every early delivery. This encourages the vendor to prioritize the business's shipments over other clients, giving them the first chance at new product shipments. Many businesses purchase their inventory in bulk to receive wholesale or discounted prices, thinking it is saving money. However, buying in bulk sometimes elongates lead times, costing the company potential sales and new customers. Depending on the lead time duration, this could actually cost the organization more than they are saving. Instead, businesses should perform a total cost analysis to determine if ordering smaller batches at higher frequencies minimizes labor and carrying costs, as well as lead times. Companies can reference previous sales data to predict their future inventory needs. Demand forecasts give businesses the chance to alert their suppliers ahead of time to avoid late deliveries. Vendors can set the order aside until they receive the alert to make the shipment. Relying on manual data consolidation often means that companies do not realize that they are understocked until it is too late. With automated inventory ordering software, businesses have access to real-time inventory data and are immediately alerted with levels that are dangerously low. Advanced ordering solutions can even be programmed to automatically submit a purchase order when products hit their reorder points to prevent stockouts. By switching to a domestic supplier, companies significantly reduce their lead times by up to several weeks, depending on the type of inventory. This way, businesses do not have to worry about delays regarding customs and international regulations. Customized components have significantly longer lead times as each product requires special attention. If businesses are able, they should switch to standard components that can be shipped in bulk and supplied quickly. Standard components also require less funding for engineering, production, and labor, making them cost-effective. However, companies that require customized components should use experts in their field that work efficiently, rather than startups that are still learning. Kitting refers to assembling products that have multiple parts. Businesses that establish kitting processes are able to group parts that are frequently used together to reduce lead times. Creating already assembled batches also improves efficiency, productivity, and order fulfillment accuracy, as employees do not have to dedicate time picking individual components.

page_content = 8 Effective Lead Time Reduction Strategies to Implement reorder point safety stock Lead time reduction eliminates unnecessary, time-consuming, and inefficient operations that elongate any part of the order fulfillment process, from production to shipping. What is Lead Time? safety stock reorder point 8 Lead Time Reduction Strategies safety stock safety stock Consolidate Suppliers Create Incentives Order Inventory Frequently daily usage average Share Sales Data with Suppliers Automate Inventory Management Use a Domestic Supplier time demand safety Use Standard Components Consider Kitting Services Retailers are only able to provide their customers with the service that they receive from suppliers. Therefore, if vendors delay inventory shipments, businesses are unable to fulfill their customers' orders on time. By practicing lead time reduction, companies can minimize their wait time for inventory orders to meet customer demand consistently. Lead time refers to how long it takes a business to process and complete an order. In other words, lead time is the amount of time it takes a customer or company to receive their order. This starts when the order is placed and ends once the package reaches its final destination, whether that is another business or the consumer. For example, if a business places a product order with their supplier and receives their shipment 10 days later, the lead time for that specific item is 10 days. However, lead times often vary between different vendors and types of inventory. For retailers, the lead time is an essential tool for calculating reorder points and safety stock to ensure they always have enough products to meet customer demand. Reorder points trigger inventory orders once stock levels dip below a healthy level. When calculated correctly, reorders buy the company enough time until they receive their shipments. Even with demand forecasting, companies may experience unexpected spikes in demand due to passing fads. In these situations, it is vital for businesses to have additional stock, or safety stock, to fulfill customer orders while more inventory is ordered. This prevents stockouts and backorders. Otherwise, stockouts could lead to unsatisfied customers that seek out their desired products elsewhere. Now more than ever, consumers expect to have their orders as soon as possible. This means that retailers also need to receive their inventory quickly. The longer businesses make their customers wait, the more likely they are to leave. Aside from creating impatient customers, extended lead times can also cost companies significant capital, from lost sales, inflated inventory costs, and expedited shipping. Therefore, organizations should consider the different methods of lead time reduction. Handling multiple suppliers sometimes has more cons than pros, as businesses tend to overlook lead times and make logistical mistakes. This can significantly elongate wait times for customers. Instead, companies should limit their backup suppliers to one or two, and consolidate other vendors. Sometimes vendors provide similar inventory for competitors within the same market, making it difficult for either business to gain a competitive edge. However, companies can incentivize reduced lead times by offering bonuses for every early delivery. This encourages the vendor to prioritize the business's shipments over other clients, giving them the first chance at new product shipments. Many businesses purchase their inventory in bulk to receive wholesale or discounted prices, thinking it is saving money. However, buying in bulk sometimes elongates lead times, costing the company potential sales and new customers. Depending on the lead time duration, this could actually cost the organization more than they are saving. Instead, businesses should perform a total cost analysis to determine if ordering smaller batches at higher frequencies minimizes labor and carrying costs, as well as lead times. Companies can reference previous sales data to predict their future inventory needs. Demand forecasts give businesses the chance to alert their suppliers ahead of time to avoid late deliveries. Vendors can set the order aside until they receive the alert to make the shipment. Relying on manual data consolidation often means that companies do not realize that they are understocked until it is too late. With automated inventory ordering software, businesses have access to real-time inventory data and are immediately alerted with levels that are dangerously low. Advanced ordering solutions can even be programmed to automatically submit a purchase order when products hit their reorder points to prevent stockouts. By switching to a domestic supplier, companies significantly reduce their lead times by up to several weeks, depending on the type of inventory. This way, businesses do not have to worry about delays regarding customs and international regulations. Customized components have significantly longer lead times as each product requires special attention. If businesses are able, they should switch to standard components that can be shipped in bulk and supplied quickly. Standard components also require less funding for engineering, production, and labor, making them cost-effective. However, companies that require customized components should use experts in their field that work efficiently, rather than startups that are still learning. Kitting refers to assembling products that have multiple parts. Businesses that establish kitting processes are able to group parts that are frequently used together to reduce lead times. Creating already assembled batches also improves efficiency, productivity, and order fulfillment accuracy, as employees do not have to dedicate time picking individual components.

page_content = Restaurant Loyalty Programs- 5 Tips and Real-Life Examples Restaurant loyalty programs reward members for visiting and making purchases, improving customer engagement, foot traffic, and sales. 5 Tips for Restaurant Loyalty Programs 1. Count Every Visit 2. Establish a Simple System 3. Provide a Personalized Experience 4. Establish a Digital and Mobile Platform 5. Train Staff on the Loyalty Program Real-Life Loyalty Program Examples In order to grow the customer base, restaurants need to keep their loyal customers happy and interested. One way to keep guests returning is offering a loyalty program. Restaurant loyalty programs offer incentives to members for making purchases. Loyal customers can redeem their earned points for monetary or personalized rewards. Retaining loyal customers is just as important as acquiring new ones, as regulars tend to spend more per order than first comers. Therefore, restaurants should incentivize repeat purchases to promote customer loyalty and advocacy. With a restaurant loyalty program, guests are rewarded for patronizing their favorite businesses, driving more sales and new customers. However, a loyalty program must provide enough incentives to encourage guests to sign up. To provide the best reward system, restaurants should- Studies show that 68% of consumers say that they are more likely to visit restaurants that offer a loyalty program over others that don't. This number grows for customers that are already enrolled in a business's loyalty program, as they seek to earn additional reward points. To encourage repeat customers, restaurants should recognize every visit when rewarding customers. Members can accumulate points during each visit or receive a punch on their card. However, it is vital to maintain a balance between work and reward. Visitors should not receive a physical reward for every visit, as frequently offering rewards can cost restaurants significant capital. A study that polled customers on the importance of loyalty programs showed that 73% considered the points system to be either very or extremely important. Most consumers are already familiar with the concept of accumulating points to earn a reward, making it easy for restaurants to implement a loyalty program for immediate use. Over half of the customers polled also said they prefer receiving gift cards as their reward. A gift certificate not only gives members the freedom to choose whatever dish they want, but it drives more traffic for the restaurant as well. It also does not limit the customers' reward to one visit, as they can split their store credit across multiple sittings. Aside from monetary rewards, such as gift cards, loyalty members prefer personalized prizes. Restaurants can use customers' personal information and data to offer customized rewards, such as- Free meal on birthdays Discounts on favorite dishes (based on purchase history) Extra points on holidays By creating a personalized customer experience, members are more likely to engage with their loyalty program to access preferred rewards. Now more than ever, customers are on-the-go and require the tools to order and earn points from anywhere. By establishing digital and mobile platforms , restaurants can provide guests with convenient service and broaden their customer reach. Having a digital presence enables restaurants to collect customer data from every order, regardless if it's in-person or online. By creating a mobile app, members can view their accounts, accumulated points, and personalized discounts with just a few clicks. Employees located at the point-of-sale (POS) should be trained to offer and enroll guests in the loyalty program. Signing up should be quick and straightforward to minimize wait times and keep customers interested. If enrolling in the program is too complex or requires extensive personal information, guests may become uncomfortable or disinterested. Some restaurants even offer new guests an additional 10% off their order to enroll. Even if guests are already enrolled in the program, workers should stress the benefits of their membership to encourage more sales. Employees should also be well-versed in- The reward structure Holiday and specialty promotions Program functionality How to persuade customers to enroll Answering frequently asked questions Nearly every popular restaurant chain has established their own unique reward system to keep members satisfied and acquire new customers. Startups and smaller restaurants should consider looking at successful loyalty program examples for inspiration- Chipotle The Chipotle rewards program grants members 10 points for every dollar they spend. Customers can redeem their points once they reach 1,250 for a free entree. However, the points expire after 60 days, creating a sense of urgency to accumulate and use points. Chipotle occasionally offers bonus points on holidays, random days, and product launches to drive sales. This keeps members engaged with their loyalty account to ensure they don't miss out on a good deal. Dunkin Donuts Dunkin Donuts gives loyalty members five points for every dollar spent but allows customers to collect their reward when they reach 200 points. Once they've reached this benchmark, members receive a free beverage of their choice. Dunking Donuts is also partnered with Shell, allowing loyal customers to receive ten cents off a gallon for every five drinks they purchase. Starbucks When customers join the Starbucks loyalty program, they automatically receive a free coffee of their choice. Once a member, customers earn a certain number of stars for each purchase. However, Starbucks uses a unique tier system to allocate points- 25 stars for additives, 50 stars for hot coffee, hot tea, and certain bakery items, 150 stars for specialty drinks and certain breakfast items, 200 stars for lunch meals, and 400 stars for certain merchandise and packaged coffee. Restaurants can create a unique loyalty program that encourages members to make frequent purchases in order to earn rewards, driving customer satisfaction and engagement.

page_content = Restaurant Loyalty Programs- 5 Tips and Real-Life Examples restaurant customer Restaurant loyalty programs reward members for visiting and making purchases, improving customer engagement, foot traffic, and sales. 5 Tips for Restaurant Loyalty Programs earn points every 1. Count Every Visit 2. Establish a Simple System 3. Provide a Personalized Experience 4. Establish a Digital and Mobile Platform 5. Train Staff on the Loyalty Program Real-Life Loyalty Program Examples In order to grow the customer base, restaurants need to keep their loyal customers happy and interested. One way to keep guests returning is offering a loyalty program. Restaurant loyalty programs offer incentives to members for making purchases. Loyal customers can redeem their earned points for monetary or personalized rewards. Retaining loyal customers is just as important as acquiring new ones, as regulars tend to spend more per order than first comers. Therefore, restaurants should incentivize repeat purchases to promote customer loyalty and advocacy. With a restaurant loyalty program, guests are rewarded for patronizing their favorite businesses, driving more sales and new customers. However, a loyalty program must provide enough incentives to encourage guests to sign up. To provide the best reward system, restaurants should- Studies show that 68% of consumers say that they are more likely to visit restaurants that offer a loyalty program over others that don't. This number grows for customers that are already enrolled in a business's loyalty program, as they seek to earn additional reward points. To encourage repeat customers, restaurants should recognize every visit when rewarding customers. Members can accumulate points during each visit or receive a punch on their card. However, it is vital to maintain a balance between work and reward. Visitors should not receive a physical reward for every visit, as frequently offering rewards can cost restaurants significant capital. A study that polled customers on the importance of loyalty programs showed that 73% considered the points system to be either very or extremely important. Most consumers are already familiar with the concept of accumulating points to earn a reward, making it easy for restaurants to implement a loyalty program for immediate use. Over half of the customers polled also said they prefer receiving gift cards as their reward. A gift certificate not only gives members the freedom to choose whatever dish they want, but it drives more traffic for the restaurant as well. It also does not limit the customers' reward to one visit, as they can split their store credit across multiple sittings. Aside from monetary rewards, such as gift cards, loyalty members prefer personalized prizes. Restaurants can use customers' personal information and data to offer customized rewards, such as- Free meal on birthdays Discounts on favorite dishes (based on purchase history) Extra points on holidays By creating a personalized customer experience, members are more likely to engage with their loyalty program to access preferred rewards. Now more than ever, customers are on-the-go and require the tools to order and earn points from anywhere. By establishing digital and mobile platforms , restaurants can provide guests with convenient service and broaden their customer reach. Having a digital presence enables restaurants to collect customer data from every order, regardless if it's in-person or online. By creating a mobile app, members can view their accounts, accumulated points, and personalized discounts with just a few clicks. Employees located at the point-of-sale (POS) should be trained to offer and enroll guests in the loyalty program. Signing up should be quick and straightforward to minimize wait times and keep customers interested. If enrolling in the program is too complex or requires extensive personal information, guests may become uncomfortable or disinterested. Some restaurants even offer new guests an additional 10% off their order to enroll. Even if guests are already enrolled in the program, workers should stress the benefits of their membership to encourage more sales. Employees should also be well-versed in- The reward structure Holiday and specialty promotions Program functionality How to persuade customers to enroll Answering frequently asked questions Nearly every popular restaurant chain has established their own unique reward system to keep members satisfied and acquire new customers. Startups and smaller restaurants should consider looking at successful loyalty program examples for inspiration- Chipotle The Chipotle rewards program grants members 10 points for every dollar they spend. Customers can redeem their points once they reach 1,250 for a free entree. However, the points expire after 60 days, creating a sense of urgency to accumulate and use points. Chipotle occasionally offers bonus points on holidays, random days, and product launches to drive sales. This keeps members engaged with their loyalty account to ensure they don't miss out on a good deal. Dunkin Donuts Dunkin Donuts gives loyalty members five points for every dollar spent but allows customers to collect their reward when they reach 200 points. Once they've reached this benchmark, members receive a free beverage of their choice. Dunking Donuts is also partnered with Shell, allowing loyal customers to receive ten cents off a gallon for every five drinks they purchase. Starbucks When customers join the Starbucks loyalty program, they automatically receive a free coffee of their choice. Once a member, customers earn a certain number of stars for each purchase. However, Starbucks uses a unique tier system to allocate points- 25 stars for additives, 50 stars for hot coffee, hot tea, and certain bakery items, 150 stars for specialty drinks and certain breakfast items, 200 stars for lunch meals, and 400 stars for certain merchandise and packaged coffee. Restaurants can create a unique loyalty program that encourages members to make frequent purchases in order to earn rewards, driving customer satisfaction and engagement.

keyword = Reorder Point Formula
page_content = How to Use the Reorder Point Formula to Optimize Inventory The reorder point formula allows businesses to determine their inventory threshold that they should not go below. With an accurate reorder point, companies can maintain optimal stock. What is the Reorder Point? How to Use the Reorder Point Formula Demand During Lead Time Safety Stock Plug Into ROP Formula Importance of a Reorder Point Cut Down Expenses Reduce Stock-Outs Improved Demand Forecasting Relationship Between Reorder Points and Safety Stock Strategies for Reorder Point Planning 1. Understand That Reorder Points Are Not Static 2. Implement New Inventory Technology 3. Assess Product and Business Performance 4. Strengthen the Supply Chain 5. Go Beyond the Reorder Point How Zip Ordering Simplifies Reorder Points Inventory Management Demand Forecasting Intuitive Reports For a business to run seamlessly and profitably, executives have to answer various questions about their inventory, such as how many raw materials or finished goods they need to purchase from their suppliers and when they should place these orders. Business teams can accurately address these key concerns by using the reorder point formula. The reorder point helps with determining a company’s inventory threshold and ensures that any delays to customer service are minimized. A reorder point is the minimum amount of inventory on hand that indicates that stock levels need to be replenished. Essentially, it is a metric that informs executives when is the best time to make a supplier order or when manufacturers need to produce more goods. Organizations will typically have reorder points for each product in their inventory, from consumables to finished items. This enhances stock management and prevents production bottlenecks and interruptions to the supply chain. Reorder points are also helpful for growing businesses that have large volumes of products because it enables managers to have better control over maintaining optimal stock levels. Business teams can calculate each of their inventory product’s reorder points by utilizing the formula - Reorder Point (ROP) = Demand During Lead Time + Safety Stock To effectively use the reorder point formula, it is important to accurately calculate demand and safety stock. Lead time refers to how long it takes from when an order is placed to when the product is finally received. This is typically quantified by the number of days. Businesses that have manufacturers or suppliers from different countries will usually experience longer lead times, compared to having domestic partners. When calculating demand during lead time, the lead time for a product must be multiplied by the average number of products sold daily. Demand During Lead Time = Lead Time x Average Daily Sales For example, if an upscale restaurant in New York has a lead time of 4 days to receive shipments of steak from Wisconsin and their average daily sales of steak is 20, their lead time demand is 80. Safety stock is the additional quantities of goods that businesses keep on hand in case of a sudden increase in demand. It is also important to be prepared with safety stock because unexpected disruptions with supplier delivery schedules and transportation can cause delayed shipments. With safety stock, operations will not be affected by these interruptions and brands can continue serving their customers. To find the ideal safety stock level to have in the warehouse, executives need to multiply the maximum daily orders to their maximum lead time. And then multiple the average daily orders to the average lead time. Afterwards, the two results must be subtracted to find the safety stock level. Therefore, if the restaurant’s daily maximum steak orders are 30 and the maximum lead time is 6 days, while the average daily sales are 20 steaks and average lead time is 4 days, the safety stock level is 100 steaks. After calculating the lead time demand and safety stock, the two values can be inputted into the reorder point formula. Thus, according to the formula, the reorder point calculation for the restaurant in New York would be - Reorder Point (ROP) = Demand During Lead Time + Safety Stock ROP = 80 + 100 ROP = 180 steaks Establishing reorder points ensure that customers’ demands are always satisfied. Other benefits of a reorder point include - Over-ordering stock and having a surplus amount of products can be an inefficient use of resources, especially if consumers are not purchasing these items. Not only would these goods take up valuable warehouse space, but they will also incur carrying costs. With reorder points, managers can make informed supplier purchases and ensure they are keeping opportune levels of stock at all times. Having too little inventory can also negatively impact a business’s bottom line because it increases the risk of stock-outs and lost sales. Reorder points help companies make timely supplier orders and guarantees that the brand has enough goods to continue selling to customers while the new order is being processed and delivered. This enables the business to provide excellent service and to uphold a dependable reputation among consumers. When calculating reorder points, business teams must also consistently monitor and assess demand trends and customer behaviors. Doing so helps executives have better visibility into their forecasting abilities and can improve projection accuracy. Understanding both reorder points and safety stock can help businesses hone in on their inventory management and optimization. These two components also help prevent stock-outs, in which reorder points ensure replenishment orders are placed and safety stock guarantees that there are extra products in the storeroom. Safety stock, also known as buffer stock, is considered a business’s last line of defense in regards to averting stock-outs. On the other hand, a reorder level is the second-to-last defense technique. Depending on calculations, safety stock can affect a business’s bottom line if its levels are too high. To lower safety stock levels and ensure that excess products will not be left unsold in the warehouse, managers can - Use Automation Digital solutions, like inventory ordering software, can provide data reports, which can be used to calculate accurate safety stock levels. These systems also enable users to set automatic reorders, so when inventory levels reach a specific point, the system will promptly place new orders. Enhance the Supply Chain By collaborating with suppliers and conducting audits on the current supply chain, business owners will have clearer visibility into their movement of goods. This allows for informed decision-making and helps highlight inventory opportunities. Decrease Lead Times Longer leads times contribute to high levels of safety stock since brands have to keep larger volumes of inventory to make up for extended delivery times. It is helpful to communicate with suppliers and ask if order fulfillments can be expedited. In the case that the supplier is unable to provide their products quicker, business owners should search for another vendor who can. Be Proactive With Shifting Demands Demands and client needs will regularly shift; therefore, management teams need to monitor these changes and strategize how they can address them. For example, ramping up marketing campaigns and advertisements can help create steady demand and ensure that safety stock will be utilized. Assess All Inventory Products It is important that executives have a comprehensive understanding and overview of their inventory. This will give them the opportunity to identify ways to optimize their stock management, such as which items do not require buffer stock. When developing plans for reorder points, organizations should consider optimizing various components in their inventory and supply chain management. Businesses can adopt these strategic approaches to their reordering points - Consumer demand trends and market conditions are turbulent and will change unexpectedly during a given period. Therefore, when business teams establish reorder points, they must regularly review them to ensure they are up-to-date. Typically, organizations will assess their reorder points every quarter to make sure that it reflects current demands. Any adjustments, such as lowering or increasing the metrics, should be done promptly. Modern inventory management software has advanced capabilities that can streamline stock control tasks. It has features that automate purchase orders and can also provide real time data reports regarding profits, inventory levels, and sales. This can create a positive impact on a business’s bottom line because it promotes informed buying decisions, inventory maintenance, and demand fulfillment. In order for a reorder point strategy to be efficient, executives must reevaluate their products' performances, as well as their marketing and advertising progress. Since trends fluctuate, it will be helpful to understand whether their reorder point strategies are working as intended and if adjustments need to be made. It is also recommended that teams assess their target demographics and see if their promotional campaigns are adequate in garnering attention for a product. Business operations will run seamlessly, as long as all partners, third-party suppliers, and distributors are proactive and reliable. When suppliers have inconsistent schedules or often have issues with adhering to established contracts, the company will be unable to efficiently meet customers’ needs. If a business owner is experiencing an undependable supplier, they should find new resources to strengthen their supply chain. Regularly examining supplier performance and performing audits will ensure that any problems or discrepancies are addressed quickly. If possible, companies should look into working with local suppliers because it allows managers to have more face-to-face interactions. Having a list of alternative suppliers will also be useful, in case current vendors are unable to supply goods. While reorder points are crucial for recognizing when to replenish inventory, management should take into account different key factors as well. For example, understanding the company’s economic order quantity will provide visibility into how much inventory the business needs to order while minimizing costs associated with holding inventory and shortages.

Count Every Visit 2. Establish a Simple System pos system 3. Provide a Personalized Experience 4. Establish a Digital and Mobile Platform restaurant pos 5. Train Staff on the Loyalty Program get free Real-Life Loyalty Program Examples points get In order to grow the customer base, restaurants need to keep their loyal customers happy and interested. One way to keep guests returning is offering a loyalty program. Restaurant loyalty programs offer incentives to members for making purchases. Loyal customers can redeem their earned points for monetary or personalized rewards. Retaining loyal customers is just as important as acquiring new ones, as regulars tend to spend more per order than first comers. Therefore, restaurants should incentivize repeat purchases to promote customer loyalty and advocacy. With a restaurant loyalty program, guests are rewarded for patronizing their favorite businesses, driving more sales and new customers. However, a loyalty program must provide enough incentives to encourage guests to sign up. To provide the best reward system, restaurants should- Studies show that 68% of consumers say that they are more likely to visit restaurants that offer a loyalty program over others that don't. This number grows for customers that are already enrolled in a business's loyalty program, as they seek to earn additional reward points. To encourage repeat customers, restaurants should recognize every visit when rewarding customers. Members can accumulate points during each visit or receive a punch on their card. However, it is vital to maintain a balance between work and reward. Visitors should not receive a physical reward for every visit, as frequently offering rewards can cost restaurants significant capital. A study that polled customers on the importance of loyalty programs showed that 73% considered the points system to be either very or extremely important. Most consumers are already familiar with the concept of accumulating points to earn a reward, making it easy for restaurants to implement a loyalty program for immediate use. Over half of the customers polled also said they prefer receiving gift cards as their reward. A gift certificate not only gives members the freedom to choose whatever dish they want, but it drives more traffic for the restaurant as well. It also does not limit the customers' reward to one visit, as they can split their store credit across multiple sittings. Aside from monetary rewards, such as gift cards, loyalty members prefer personalized prizes. Restaurants can use customers' personal information and data to offer customized rewards, such as- Free meal on birthdays Discounts on favorite dishes (based on purchase history) Extra points on holidays By creating a personalized customer experience, members are more likely to engage with their loyalty program to access preferred rewards. Now more than ever, customers are on-the-go and require the tools to order and earn points from anywhere. By establishing digital and mobile platforms , restaurants can provide guests with convenient service and broaden their customer reach. Having a digital presence enables restaurants to collect customer data from every order, regardless if it's in-person or online. By creating a mobile app, members can view their accounts, accumulated points, and personalized discounts with just a few clicks. Employees located at the point-of-sale (POS) should be trained to offer and enroll guests in the loyalty program. Signing up should be quick and straightforward to minimize wait times and keep customers interested. If enrolling in the program is too complex or requires extensive personal information, guests may become uncomfortable or disinterested. Some restaurants even offer new guests an additional 10% off their order to enroll. Even if guests are already enrolled in the program, workers should stress the benefits of their membership to encourage more sales. Employees should also be well-versed in- The reward structure Holiday and specialty promotions Program functionality How to persuade customers to enroll Answering frequently asked questions Nearly every popular restaurant chain has established their own unique reward system to keep members satisfied and acquire new customers. Startups and smaller restaurants should consider looking at successful loyalty program examples for inspiration- Chipotle The Chipotle rewards program grants members 10 points for every dollar they spend. Customers can redeem their points once they reach 1,250 for a free entree. However, the points expire after 60 days, creating a sense of urgency to accumulate and use points. Chipotle occasionally offers bonus points on holidays, random days, and product launches to drive sales. This keeps members engaged with their loyalty account to ensure they don't miss out on a good deal. Dunkin Donuts Dunkin Donuts gives loyalty members five points for every dollar spent but allows customers to collect their reward when they reach 200 points. Once they've reached this benchmark, members receive a free beverage of their choice. Dunking Donuts is also partnered with Shell, allowing loyal customers to receive ten cents off a gallon for every five drinks they purchase. Starbucks When customers join the Starbucks loyalty program, they automatically receive a free coffee of their choice. Once a member, customers earn a certain number of stars for each purchase. However, Starbucks uses a unique tier system to allocate points- 25 stars for additives, 50 stars for hot coffee, hot tea, and certain bakery items, 150 stars for specialty drinks and certain breakfast items, 200 stars for lunch meals, and 400 stars for certain merchandise and packaged coffee. Restaurants can create a unique loyalty program that encourages members to make frequent purchases in order to earn rewards, driving customer satisfaction and engagement.

Count Every Visit 2. Establish a Simple System pos system 3. Provide a Personalized Experience 4. Establish a Digital and Mobile Platform restaurant pos 5. Train Staff on the Loyalty Program get free Real-Life Loyalty Program Examples points get In order to grow the customer base, restaurants need to keep their loyal customers happy and interested. One way to keep guests returning is offering a loyalty program. Restaurant loyalty programs offer incentives to members for making purchases. Loyal customers can redeem their earned points for monetary or personalized rewards.Retaining loyal customers is just as important as acquiring new ones, as regulars tend to spend more per order than first comers. Therefore, restaurants should incentivize repeat purchases to promote customer loyalty and advocacy. With a restaurant loyalty program, guests are rewarded for patronizing their favorite businesses, driving more sales and new customers. However, a loyalty program must provide enough incentives to encourage guests to sign up. To provide the best reward system, restaurants should-Studies show that 68% of consumers say that they are more likely to visit restaurants that offer a loyalty program over others that don't. This number grows for customers that are already enrolled in a business's loyalty program, as they seek to earn additional reward points. To encourage repeat customers, restaurants should recognize every visit when rewarding customers. Members can accumulate points during each visit or receive a punch on their card. However, it is vital to maintain a balance between work and reward. Visitors should not receive a physical reward for every visit, as frequently offering rewards can cost restaurants significant capital.A study that polled customers on the importance of loyalty programs showed that 73% considered the points system to be either very or extremely important. Most consumers are already familiar with the concept of accumulating points to earn a reward, making it easy for restaurants to implement a loyalty program for immediate use. Over half of the customers polled also said they prefer receiving gift cards as their reward. A gift certificate not only gives members the freedom to choose whatever dish they want, but it drives more traffic for the restaurant as well. It also does not limit the customers' reward to one visit, as they can split their store credit across multiple sittings.Aside from monetary rewards, such as gift cards, loyalty members prefer personalized prizes. Restaurants can use customers' personal information and data to offer customized rewards , such as- Free meal on birthdays Discounts on favorite dishes (based on purchase history) Extra points on holidays By creating a personalized customer experience, members are more likely to engage with their loyalty program to access preferred rewards.Now more than ever, customers are on-the-go and require the tools to order and earn points from anywhere. By establishing digital and mobile platforms , restaurants can provide guests with convenient service and broaden their customer reach. Having a digital presence enables restaurants to collect customer data from every order, regardless if it's in-person or online. By creating a mobile app, members can view their accounts, accumulated points, and personalized discounts with just a few clicks.Employees located at the point-of-sale (POS) should be trained to offer and enroll guests in the loyalty program. Signing up should be quick and straightforward to minimize wait times and keep customers interested. If enrolling in the program is too complex or requires extensive personal information, guests may become uncomfortable or disinterested. Some restaurants even offer new guests an additional 10% off their order to enroll. Even if guests are already enrolled in the program, workers should stress the benefits of their membership to encourage more sales. Employees should also be well-versed in- The reward structure Holiday and specialty promotions Program functionality How to persuade customers to enroll Answering frequently asked questions Nearly every popular restaurant chain has established their own unique reward system to keep members satisfied and acquire new customers. Startups and smaller restaurants should consider looking at successful loyalty program examples for inspiration- Chipotle The Chipotle rewards program grants members 10 points for every dollar they spend. Customers can redeem their points once they reach 1,250 for a free entree. However, the points expire after 60 days, creating a sense of urgency to accumulate and use points. Chipotle occasionally offers bonus points on holidays, random days, and product launches to drive sales. This keeps members engaged with their loyalty account to ensure they don't miss out on a good deal. Dunkin Donuts Dunkin Donuts gives loyalty members five points for every dollar spent but allows customers to collect their reward when they reach 200 points. Once they've reached this benchmark, members receive a free beverage of their choice. Dunking Donuts is also partnered with Shell, allowing loyal customers to receive ten cents off a gallon for every five drinks they purchase. Starbucks When customers join the Starbucks loyalty program, they automatically receive a free coffee of their choice. Once a member, customers earn a certain number of stars for each purchase. However, Starbucks uses a unique tier system to allocate points- 25 stars for additives, 50 stars for hot coffee, hot tea, and certain bakery items, 150 stars for specialty drinks and certain breakfast items, 200 stars for lunch meals, and 400 stars for certain merchandise and packaged coffee. Restaurants can create a unique loyalty program that encourages members to make frequent purchases in order to earn rewards, driving customer satisfaction and engagement.

keyword = Reorder Point Formula
page_content = How to Use the Reorder Point Formula to Optimize Inventory inventory control The reorder point formula allows businesses to determine their inventory threshold that they should not go below. With an accurate reorder point, companies can maintain optimal stock. What is the Reorder Point? replenishment point How to Use the Reorder Point Formula Demand During Lead Time Safety Stock buffer stock Plug Into ROP Formula Importance of a Reorder Point Cut Down Expenses budgeting Reduce Stock-Outs Improved Demand Forecasting Relationship Between Reorder Points and Safety Stock out of stock demand customers Strategies for Reorder Point Planning 1. Understand That Reorder Points Are Not Static 2. Implement New Inventory Technology software 3. Assess Product and Business Performance 4. Strengthen the Supply Chain supply chain 5. Go Beyond the Reorder Point How Zip Ordering Simplifies Reorder Points Inventory Management Demand Forecasting demand Intuitive Reports For a business to run seamlessly and profitably, executives have to answer various questions about their inventory, such as how many raw materials or finished goods they need to purchase from their suppliers and when they should place these orders. Business teams can accurately address these key concerns by using the reorder point formula. The reorder point helps with determining a company’s inventory threshold and ensures that any delays to customer service are minimized. A reorder point is the minimum amount of inventory on hand that indicates that stock levels need to be replenished. Essentially, it is a metric that informs executives when is the best time to make a supplier order or when manufacturers need to produce more goods. Organizations will typically have reorder points for each product in their inventory, from consumables to finished items. This enhances stock management and prevents production bottlenecks and interruptions to the supply chain. Reorder points are also helpful for growing businesses that have large volumes of products because it enables managers to have better control over maintaining optimal stock levels. Business teams can calculate each of their inventory product’s reorder points by utilizing the formula - Reorder Point (ROP) = Demand During Lead Time + Safety Stock To effectively use the reorder point formula, it is important to accurately calculate demand and safety stock. Lead time refers to how long it takes from when an order is placed to when the product is finally received. This is typically quantified by the number of days. Businesses that have manufacturers or suppliers from different countries will usually experience longer lead times, compared to having domestic partners. When calculating demand during lead time, the lead time for a product must be multiplied by the average number of products sold daily. Demand During Lead Time = Lead Time x Average Daily Sales For example, if an upscale restaurant in New York has a lead time of 4 days to receive shipments of steak from Wisconsin and their average daily sales of steak is 20, their lead time demand is 80. Safety stock is the additional quantities of goods that businesses keep on hand in case of a sudden increase in demand. It is also important to be prepared with safety stock because unexpected disruptions with supplier delivery schedules and transportation can cause delayed shipments. With safety stock, operations will not be affected by these interruptions and brands can continue serving their customers. To find the ideal safety stock level to have in the warehouse, executives need to multiply the maximum daily orders to their maximum lead time. And then multiple the average daily orders to the average lead time. Afterward, the two results must be subtracted to find the safety stock level. Therefore, if the restaurant’s daily maximum steak orders are 30 and the maximum lead time is 6 days, while the average daily sales are 20 steaks and average lead time is 4 days, the safety stock level is 100 steaks. After calculating the lead time demand and safety stock, the two values can be inputted into the reorder point formula. Thus, according to the formula, the reorder point calculation for the restaurant in New York would be - Reorder Point (ROP) = Demand During Lead Time + Safety Stock ROP = 80 + 100 ROP = 180 steaks Establishing reorder points ensure that customers’ demands are always satisfied. Other benefits of a reorder point include - Over-ordering stock and having a surplus amount of products can be an inefficient use of resources, especially if consumers are not purchasing these items. Not only would these goods take up valuable warehouse space, but they will also incur carrying costs. With reorder points, managers can make informed supplier purchases and ensure they are keeping opportune levels of stock at all times. Having too little inventory can also negatively impact a business’s bottom line because it increases the risk of stock-outs and lost sales. Reorder points help companies make timely supplier orders and guarantees that the brand has enough goods to continue selling to customers while the new order is being processed and delivered. This enables the business to provide excellent service and to uphold a dependable reputation among consumers. When calculating reorder points, business teams must also consistently monitor and assess demand trends and customer behaviors. Doing so helps executives have better visibility into their forecasting abilities and can improve projection accuracy. Understanding both reorder points and safety stock can help businesses hone in on their inventory management and optimization. These two components also help prevent stock-outs, in which reorder points ensure replenishment orders are placed and safety stock guarantees that there are extra products in the storeroom. Safety stock, also known as buffer stock, is considered a business’s last line of defense in regards to averting stock-outs. On the other hand, a reorder level is the second-to-last defense technique. Depending on calculations, safety stock can affect a business’s bottom line if its levels are too high. To lower safety stock levels and ensure that excess products will not be left unsold in the warehouse, managers can - Use Automation Digital solutions, like inventory ordering software, can provide data reports, which can be used to calculate accurate safety stock levels. These systems also enable users to set automatic reorders, so when inventory levels reach a specific point, the system will promptly place new orders. Enhance the Supply Chain By collaborating with suppliers and conducting audits on the current supply chain, business owners will have clearer visibility into their movement of goods. This allows for informed decision-making and helps highlight inventory opportunities. Decrease Lead Times Longer leads times contribute to high levels of safety stock since brands have to keep larger volumes of inventory to make up for extended delivery times. It is helpful to communicate with suppliers and ask if order fulfillments can be expedited. In the case that the supplier is unable to provide their products quicker, business owners should search for another vendor who can. Be Proactive With Shifting Demands Demands and client needs will regularly shift; therefore, management teams need to monitor these changes and strategize how they can address them. For example, ramping up marketing campaigns and advertisements can help create steady demand and ensure that safety stock will be utilized. Assess All Inventory Products It is important that executives have a comprehensive understanding and overview of their inventory. This will give them the opportunity to identify ways to optimize their stock management, such as which items do not require buffer stock. When developing plans for reorder points, organizations should consider optimizing various components in their inventory and supply chain management. Businesses can adopt these strategic approaches to their reordering points - Consumer demand trends and market conditions are turbulent and will change unexpectedly during a given period. Therefore, when business teams establish reorder points, they must regularly review them to ensure they are up-to-date. Typically, organizations will assess their reorder points every quarter to make sure that it reflects current demands. Any adjustments, such as lowering or increasing the metrics, should be done promptly. Modern inventory management software has advanced capabilities that can streamline stock control tasks. It has features that automate purchase orders and can also provide real time data reports regarding profits, inventory levels, and sales. This can create a positive impact on a business’s bottom line because it promotes informed buying decisions, inventory maintenance, and demand fulfillment. In order for a reorder point strategy to be efficient, executives must reevaluate their products' performances, as well as their marketing and advertising progress. Since trends fluctuate, it will be helpful to understand whether their reorder point strategies are working as intended and if adjustments need to be made. It is also recommended that teams assess their target demographics and see if their promotional campaigns are adequate in garnering attention for a product. Business operations will run seamlessly, as long as all partners, third-party suppliers, and distributors are proactive and reliable. When suppliers have inconsistent schedules or often have issues with adhering to established contracts, the company will be unable to efficiently meet customers’ needs. If a business owner is experiencing an undependable supplier, they should find new resources to strengthen their supply chain. Regularly examining supplier performance and performing audits will ensure that any problems or discrepancies are addressed quickly. If possible, companies should look into working with local suppliers because it allows managers to have more face-to-face interactions. Having a list of alternative suppliers will also be useful, in case current vendors are unable to supply goods. While reorder points are crucial for recognizing when to replenish inventory, management should take into account different key factors as well. For example, understanding the company’s economic order quantity will provide visibility into how much inventory the business needs to order while minimizing costs associated with holding inventory and shortages.

This digital tool helps businesses streamline time-consuming and laborious tasks associated with maintaining stock and managing suppliers.

page_content = 7 Reasons Why You Need an Electronic Menu Board Example of an electronic menu board Electronic menu boards provide ample opportunities for restaurants to improve sales and draw in consumers through impressionable visuals and brand optimization. 1. Simpler to Change and Update Electronic menu board - outside of a restaurant 2. More Impressionable 3. Creates a Call to Action Electronic menu board - Manager answering phone 4. Sales Data Can Be Evaluated More Efficiently 5. Menu Apps That Work for You 6. ROI Electronic menu board - Patrons eating out at a restaurant 7. Brand Consistency Don't Miss Out on Electronic Menu Boards Electronic menu board - Man looking at menu The current population is obsessed with digitized media. Whether it be televisions, smartphones, iPads, or social media, the nation is full of potential consumers who want to receive their information through digitized means. Companies are drastically updating and reworking their own advertisements and signage in order to keep up with this trend. Furthermore, they need their messaging to be more progressive and innovative than the competition. Just like any other industry, restaurants have instinctively moved towards incorporating digital trends into their advertisements and signage. An electronic menu board, or menus controlled digitally, are one of the recent courses of action that restaurants have taken to move in this direction. Here's some benefits of using an electronic menu board. Old-fashioned signage often takes longer to update because it is sometimes handwritten, and includes decorations that are finished individually, instead of by a computer. Sometimes smaller restaurants use chalkboards with tedious calligraphy and hand-drawn artwork. Though owners may think this gives their restaurant a unique flair, this type of work also takes up quality time and resources. Luckily, electronic menu boards can be updated quickly on a user-friendly app, at any time, and at any location. Global restaurants or larger chains that change their signage on a regular basis will find it to be much easier to move towards digitization, as they have many more locations, franchises, and updates every day. Regular signage isn't going to usually have the wow factor that draws consumers in to buy a sandwich. Colors aren't as vibrant, nor are their promotional campaigns as big, so there's less engagement from consumers. Electronic menu boards incorporate more high-quality visuals, such as vibrant coloring, detailed pictures and engaging videos. If there's a particular item that is the special of the day or a special that the company is promoting, an electronic menu board can highlight this featured item by showcasing its picture in more visible locations of the establishment. In other words, companies can create the impressions they want, when they want, and where they want with electronic menu boards. Because of the potent visual effects that digitization imparts, electronic menu boards provide opportunities for restaurants to draw consumers in towards performing a specific action. This includes buying that special of the day, or signing up for a new reward program. On a side note, this can also help build up a restaurant's social media following and creates interest in the company website. Making that information more visual to the consumer entices them to follow the restaurant online, especially if there's a monetary incentive to do so. For example, a restaurant can offer specials on electronic menu boards that are only available if someone signs up via email. Or they can incentivize consumers to re-share a picture of themselves at the restaurant on Instagram, in order to qualify for a buy 1-get 1 promotion. With traditional signage, it takes much longer to evaluate and correlate sales data because there aren't the same opportunities to create calls to action and make products more impressionable to consumers. Electronic menu boards offer ample opportunities for companies to incorporate calls to action, so a digital sales campaign can evaluate this data on a day-by-day basis. Restaurants can look at what consumers are buying every day, and modify their business to better fulfill the needs of the consumer. This means staying fully stocked on popular items, knowing when to replenish ingredients, and removing menu options that aren't meeting expectations. Managers can change their menu items anywhere, from any location simply by using digital menu apps on their smartphones or tablets that allow for quick fixes and updates on promotions. This provides opportunities for larger restaurant chains to easily outsource updates to the managerial staff at specific franchises. It also saves the need for any artistic skills, because the app already has a qualified team curating an optimized design that exemplifies the restaurant's unique brand. Electronic menu boards improve sales dramatically by creating more calls to action through visual effects, so restaurants will see the money spent on electronic menu boards come back, ten-fold. Restaurants can also easily experiment with design promotions by utilizing software within their app that work with digital campaigns to see how well they are performing. These software tools can do simple testing by taking two slightly different designs (A/B testing) and comparing how well they perform against each other under different variables. Restaurants can then take whatever design performs the best out of those two, and use it in their digital campaign to get a better return on investment. With traditional signage, there's not a precise way to test out a campaign like this because it's difficult to correlate an increase in sales with a sign or menu without knowing which variable caused it. These apps provide the software to do so. One of the best parts about electronic menu boards is the ability that companies have to promote their brand from within. There are ample opportunities to display company logos or advertisements, or messaging that is not available on an old-fashioned menu. While restaurants can promote their brand, they can also make sure that it stays consistent amongst their other multiple chains. There's also always an inherent risk with old-fashioned signage that employees forget to change an item on the board. Electronic menu boards prevent that from happening because restaurants can make sure all of their franchise locations are consistent, no matter where they are. Though many restaurants are weary to switch from traditional menus to electronic menu boards, the opportunities that they provide for sales growth and consumer happiness cannot be understated. The modern trend is towards digitization, and all larger restaurants are moving towards changing their menus to be more innovative and creative through the utilization of digital menus. Consumers will provide a return on investment by taking advantage of the new call to actions that are utilized, and will be drawn in by the impressionable visual effects. The path of the future is digitization, and restaurants need to be on board.

page_content = 7 Reasons Why You Need an Electronic Menu Board Example of an electronic menu board Electronic menu boards provide ample opportunities for restaurants to improve sales and draw in consumers through impressionable visuals, board templates, and brand optimization. 1. Simpler to Change and Update Electronic menu board - outside of a restaurant 2. More Impressionable 3. Creates a Call to Action Electronic menu board - Manager answering phone 4. Sales Data Can Be Evaluated More Efficiently 5. Menu Apps That Work for You 6. ROI Electronic menu board - Patrons eating out at a restaurant 7. Brand Consistency Don't Miss Out on Electronic Menu Boards Electronic menu board - Man looking at menu The current population is obsessed with digitized media. Whether it be televisions, smartphones, digital signage, iPads, or social media, the nation is full of potential consumers who want to receive their information through digitized means. Companies are drastically updating and reworking their own advertisements and signage in order to keep up with this trend. Furthermore, they need their messaging to be more progressive and innovative than the competition. Just like any other industry, restaurants have instinctively moved towards incorporating digital trends into their advertisements and signage. An electronic menu board, or menus controlled digitally, are one of the recent courses of action that restaurants have taken to move in this direction. Here's some benefits of using an electronic menu board and signage software. Old-fashioned signage often takes longer to update because it is sometimes handwritten, and includes decorations that are finished individually, instead of by a computer. Sometimes smaller restaurants use chalkboards with tedious calligraphy and hand-drawn artwork. Though owners may think this gives their restaurant a unique flair, this type of work also takes up quality time and resources. Luckily, electronic menu boards can be updated quickly on a user-friendly app, at any time, and at any location. Global restaurants or fast food chains that change their menu board templates on a regular basis will find it to be much easier to move towards digitization, as they have many more locations, franchises, and updates every day. Regular signage isn't going to usually have the wow factor that draws consumers in to buy a sandwich. Colors aren't as vibrant, nor are their promotional campaigns as big, so there's less engagement from consumers. Electronic menu boards incorporate more high-quality visuals, such as vibrant coloring, detailed pictures and engaging videos. If there's a particular item that is the special of the day or a special that the company is promoting, an electronic menu board can highlight this featured item by showcasing its picture in more visible locations of the establishment. In other words, companies can create the impressions they want, when they want, and where they want with electronic menu boards. Because of the potent visual effects that digitization imparts, electronic menu boards provide opportunities for restaurants to draw consumers in towards performing a specific action. This includes buying that special of the day, or signing up for a new reward program. On a side note, this can also help build up a restaurant's social media following and creates interest in the company website. Making that information more visual to the consumer entices them to follow the restaurant online, especially if there's a monetary incentive to do so. For example, a restaurant can offer specials on electronic menu boards that are only available if someone signs up via email. Or they can incentivize consumers to re-share a picture of themselves at the restaurant on Instagram, in order to qualify for a buy 1-get 1 promotion. With traditional signage, it takes much longer to evaluate and correlate sales data because there aren't the same opportunities to create calls to action and make products more impressionable to consumers. Electronic menu boards offer ample opportunities for companies to incorporate calls to action and decrease perceived wait times, so a digital sales campaign can evaluate this data on a day-by-day basis. Restaurants can use their menu board solution to look at what consumers are buying every day, and modify their business to better fulfill the needs of the consumer. This means staying fully stocked on popular items, knowing when to replenish ingredients, and removing menu options that aren't meeting expectations. Managers can change their menu items or nutritional information from anywhere, from any location simply by using digital menu apps on their smartphones or tablets that allow for quick fixes and updates on promotions. This provides opportunities for larger restaurant chains to easily outsource updates to the managerial staff at specific franchises. It also saves the need for any artistic skills, because the app already has a qualified team curating an optimized design that exemplifies the restaurant's unique brand. Electronic menu boards improve sales dramatically by creating more calls to action through visual effects, so restaurants will see the money spent on electronic menu boards come back, ten-fold. Restaurants can also easily experiment with design promotions by utilizing software within their app that work with digital campaigns to see how well they are performing. These software tools can do simple testing by taking two slightly different designs (A/B testing) and comparing how well they perform against each other under different variables. Restaurants can then take whatever design performs the best out of those two, and use it in their digital campaign to get a better return on investment. With traditional signage, there's not a precise way to test out a campaign like this because it's difficult to correlate an increase in sales with a sign or menu without knowing which variable caused it. These apps provide the software to do so. One of the best parts about electronic menu boards is the ability that companies have to promote their brand from within. There are ample opportunities to display company logos or advertisements, or messaging that is not available on an old-fashioned menu. While restaurants can promote their brand, they can also make sure that it stays consistent amongst their other multiple chains. There's also always an inherent risk with old-fashioned signage that employees forget to change an item on the board. Electronic menu boards prevent that from happening because restaurants can make sure all of their franchise locations are consistent, no matter where they are. Though many restaurants are weary to switch from traditional menus to digital menu boards, the opportunities that they provide for sales growth and consumer happiness cannot be understated. The modern trend is towards digitization, and all larger restaurants are moving towards changing their menus to be more innovative and creative through the utilization of digital menus. Consumers will provide a return on investment by taking advantage of the new call to actions that are utilized, and will be drawn in by the impressionable visual effects. The path of the future is digitization, and restaurants need to be on board.

keyword = Electronic Menu Board
page_content = 7 Reasons Why You Need an Electronic Menu Board Example of an electronic menu board Electronic menu boards provide ample opportunities for restaurants to improve sales and draw in consumers through impressionable visuals, board templates, and brand optimization. 1. Simpler to Change and Update Electronic menu board - outside of a restaurant 2. More Impressionable 3. Creates a Call to Action Electronic menu board - Manager answering phone 4. Sales Data Can Be Evaluated More Efficiently 5. Menu Apps That Work for You 6. ROI Electronic menu board - Patrons eating out at a restaurant 7. Brand Consistency Don't Miss Out on Electronic Menu Boards Electronic menu board - Man looking at menu The current population is obsessed with digitized media. Whether it be televisions, smartphones, digital signage, iPads, or social media, the nation is full of potential consumers who want to receive their information through digitized means. Companies are drastically updating and reworking their own advertisements and signage in order to keep up with this trend. Furthermore, they need their messaging to be more progressive and innovative than the competition. Just like any other industry, restaurants have instinctively moved towards incorporating digital trends into their advertisements and signage. An electronic menu board, or menus controlled digitally, are one of the recent courses of action that restaurants have taken to move in this direction. Here's some benefits of using an electronic menu board and signage software. Old-fashioned signage displays often takes longer to update because it is sometimes handwritten, and includes decorations that are finished individually, instead of by a computer. Sometimes smaller restaurants use chalkboards with tedious calligraphy and hand-drawn artwork. Though owners may think this gives their restaurant a unique flair, this type of work also takes up quality time and resources. Luckily, electronic menu boards can be updated quickly on a user-friendly app, at any time, and at any location. Global restaurants or fast food chains that change their menu board templates on a regular basis will find it to be much easier to move towards digitization, as they have many more locations, franchises, and updates every day. Regular digital signage displays aren't going to usually have the wow factor that draws consumers in to buy a sandwich. Colors aren't as vibrant, nor are their promotional campaigns as big, so there's less engagement from consumers. Electronic menu boards incorporate more high-quality visuals, such as vibrant coloring, detailed pictures and engaging videos. If there's a particular item that is the special of the day or a special that the company is promoting, an electronic menu board can highlight this featured item by showcasing its picture in more visible locations of the establishment. In other words, companies can create the impressions they want, when they want, and where they want with electronic menu boards. Because of the potent visual effects that digitization imparts, electronic menu boards provide opportunities for restaurants to draw consumers in towards performing a specific action. This includes buying that special of the day, or signing up for a new reward program. On a side note, providing this quick service also help build up a restaurant's social media following and creates interest in the company website. Making that information more visual to the consumer entices them to follow the restaurant online, especially if there's a monetary incentive to do so. For example, a restaurant can offer specials on electronic menu boards that are only available if someone signs up via email. Or they can incentivize consumers to re-share a picture of themselves at the restaurant on Instagram, in order to qualify for a buy 1-get 1 promotion. With traditional non web-based signage, it takes much longer to evaluate and correlate sales data because there aren't the same opportunities to create calls to action and make products more impressionable to consumers. Electronic menu boards offer ample opportunities for companies to incorporate calls to action and decrease perceived wait times, so a digital sales campaign can evaluate this data on a day-by-day basis. Restaurants can use their menu board solution to look at what consumers are buying every day, and modify their business to better fulfill the needs of the consumer. This means staying fully stocked on popular items, knowing when to replenish ingredients, and removing menu options that aren't meeting expectations. Managers can change their menu items or nutritional information from anywhere, from any location simply by using digital menu apps on their smartphones or tablets that allow for quick fixes and updates on promotions. This provides opportunities for larger restaurant chains to easily outsource updates to the managerial staff at specific franchises. It also saves the need for any artistic skills, because the app already has a qualified team curating an optimized design on a new menu that exemplifies the restaurant's unique brand. Electronic menu boards improve sales dramatically by creating more calls to action through visual effects, so restaurants will see the money spent on electronic menu boards come back, ten-fold. Restaurants can also easily experiment with design promotions by utilizing software within their app that work with digital campaigns to see how well they are performing. These software tools can do simple testing by taking two slightly different designs (A/B testing) and comparing how well they perform against each other under different variables. Restaurants can then take whatever design performs the best out of those two, and use it in their digital campaign to get a better return on investment. With traditional signage, there's not a precise way to test out a campaign like this because it's difficult to correlate an increase in sales with a sign or menu without knowing which variable caused it. These apps provide the software to do so. One of the best parts about electronic menu boards is the ability that companies have to promote their brand from within. There are ample opportunities to display company logos or advertisements, or messaging that is not available on an old-fashioned menu. While restaurants can promote their brand, they can also make sure that it stays consistent amongst their other multiple chains. There's also always an inherent risk with old-fashioned signage that employees forget to change an item on the board. Electronic menu boards prevent that from happening because restaurants can make sure all of their franchise locations are consistent, no matter where they are. Though many restaurants are weary to switch from traditional menus to digital menu boards, the opportunities that they provide for sales growth and consumer happiness cannot be understated. The modern trend is towards digitization, and all larger restaurants are moving towards changing their menus to be more innovative and creative through the utilization of digital menus. Consumers will provide a return on investment by taking advantage of the new call to actions that are utilized, and will be drawn in by the impressionable visual effects. The path of the future is digitization, and restaurants need to be on board.

Simpler to Change and Update Electronic menu board - outside of a restaurant 2. More Impressionable 3. Creates a Call to Action Electronic menu board - Manager answering phone 4. Sales Data Can Be Evaluated More Efficiently 5. Menu Apps That Work for You 6. ROI Electronic menu board - Patrons eating out at a restaurant 7. Brand Consistency Don't Miss Out on Electronic Menu Boards Electronic menu board - Man looking at menu The current population is obsessed with digitized media. Whether it be televisions, smartphones, digital signage, iPads, or social media, the nation is full of potential consumers who want to receive their information through digitized means. Companies are drastically updating and reworking their own advertisements and signage in order to keep up with this trend. Furthermore, they need their messaging to be more progressive and innovative than the competition. Just like any other industry, restaurants have instinctively moved towards incorporating digital trends into their advertisements and signage. An electronic menu board, or menus controlled digitally, are one of the recent courses of action that restaurants have taken to move in this direction. Here's some benefits of using an electronic menu board and signage software. Old-fashioned signage displays often takes longer to update because it is sometimes handwritten, and includes decorations that are finished individually, instead of by a computer. Sometimes smaller restaurants use chalkboards with tedious calligraphy and hand-drawn artwork. Though owners may think this gives their restaurant a unique flair, this type of work also takes up quality time and resources. Luckily, electronic menu boards can be updated quickly on a user-friendly app, at any time, and at any location. Global restaurants or fast food chains that change their menu board templates on a regular basis will find it to be much easier to move towards digitization, as they have many more locations, franchises, and updates every day. Regular digital signage displays aren't going to usually have the wow factor that draws consumers in to buy a sandwich. Colors aren't as vibrant, nor are their promotional campaigns as big, so there's less engagement from consumers. Electronic menu boards incorporate more high-quality visuals, such as vibrant coloring, detailed pictures and engaging videos. If there's a particular item that is the special of the day or a special that the company is promoting, an electronic menu board can highlight this featured item by showcasing its picture in more visible locations of the establishment. In other words, companies can create the impressions they want, when they want, and where they want with electronic menu boards. Because of the potent visual effects that digitization imparts, electronic menu boards provide opportunities for restaurants to draw consumers in towards performing a specific action. This includes buying that special of the day, or signing up for a new reward program. On a side note, providing this quick service also help build up a restaurant's social media following and creates interest in the company website. Making that information more visual to the consumer entices them to follow the restaurant online, especially if there's a monetary incentive to do so. For example, a restaurant can offer specials on electronic menu boards that are only available if someone signs up via email. Or they can incentivize consumers to re-share a picture of themselves at the restaurant on Instagram, in order to qualify for a buy 1-get 1 promotion. With traditional non web-based signage, it takes much longer to evaluate and correlate sales data because there aren't the same opportunities to create calls to action and make products more impressionable to consumers.

The path of the future is digitization, and restaurants need to be on board.

page_content = 7 Reasons Why You Need an Electronic Menu Board Example of an electronic menu board Electronic menu boards provide ample opportunities for restaurants to improve sales and draw in consumers through impressionable visuals, board templates, dinner menus, and brand optimization. 1. Simpler to Change and Update Electronic menu board - outside of a restaurant 2. More Impressionable 3. Creates a Call to Action Electronic menu board - Manager answering phone 4. Sales Data Can Be Evaluated More Efficiently 5. Menu Apps That Work for You 6. ROI Electronic menu board - Patrons eating out at a restaurant 7. Brand Consistency Don't Miss Out on Electronic Menu Boards Electronic menu board - Man looking at menu The current population is obsessed with digitized media. Whether it be televisions, smartphones, digital signage, iPads, or social media, the nation is full of potential consumers who want to receive their information through digitized means. Companies are drastically updating and reworking their own advertisements and signage in order to keep up with this trend. Furthermore, they need their messaging to be more progressive and innovative than the competition. Just like any other industry, restaurants have instinctively moved towards incorporating digital trends into their advertisements and signage. An electronic menu board, or menus controlled digitally, are one of the recent courses of action that restaurants have taken to move in this direction. Here's some benefits of using an electronic menu board and signage software. Old-fashioned signage displays often takes longer to update because it is sometimes handwritten, and includes decorations that are finished individually, instead of by a computer. Sometimes smaller restaurants use chalkboards with tedious calligraphy and hand-drawn artwork. Though owners may think this gives their restaurant a unique flair, this type of work also takes up quality time and resources. Luckily, electronic menu boards can be updated quickly on a user-friendly app, at any time, and at any location. Global restaurants or fast food chains that change their menu board templates on a regular basis will find it to be much easier to move towards digitization, as they have many more locations, franchises, and updates every day. Regular digital signage displays aren't going to usually have the wow factor that draws consumers in to buy a sandwich. Colors aren't as vibrant, nor are their promotional campaigns as big, so there's less engagement from consumers. Electronic menu boards incorporate more high-quality visuals, such as vibrant coloring, detailed pictures and engaging videos about breakfast, lunch, dinner. If there's a particular item that is the special of the day or a special that the company is promoting, an electronic menu board can highlight this featured item by showcasing its picture in more visible locations of the establishment. In other words, companies can create the impressions they want, when they want, and where they want with electronic menu boards. Because of the potent visual effects that digitization imparts, electronic menu boards provide opportunities for restaurants to draw consumers in towards performing a specific action. This includes buying that special of the day, or signing up for a new reward program. On a side note, providing this quick service also help build up a restaurant's social media following and creates interest in the company website. Making that information more visual to the consumer entices them to follow the restaurant online, especially if there's a monetary incentive to do so. For example, a restaurant can offer specials on electronic menu boards that are only available if someone signs up via email. Or they can incentivize consumers to re-share a picture of themselves at the restaurant on Instagram, in order to qualify for a buy 1-get 1 promotion. With traditional non web-based signage, it takes much longer to evaluate and correlate sales data because there aren't the same opportunities to create calls to action and make products more impressionable to consumers. Electronic menu boards offer ample opportunities for companies to incorporate calls to action and decrease perceived wait times, so a digital sales campaign can evaluate this data on a day-by-day basis. Restaurants can use their menu board solution to look at what consumers are buying every day, and modify their business to better fulfill the needs of the consumer. This means staying fully stocked on popular items, knowing when to replenish ingredients, and removing menu options that aren't meeting expectations. Managers can change their menu items or nutritional information from anywhere, from any location simply by using digital menu apps on their smartphones or tablets that allow for quick fixes and updates on promotions. This provides opportunities for larger restaurant chains to easily outsource updates to the managerial staff at specific franchises. It also saves the need for any artistic skills, because the app already has a qualified team curating an optimized design on a new menu that exemplifies the restaurant's unique brand. Electronic menu boards improve sales dramatically by creating more calls to action through visual effects, so restaurants will see the money spent on electronic menu boards come back, ten-fold. Restaurants can also easily experiment with design promotions by utilizing software within their app that work with digital campaigns to see how well they are performing. These software tools can do simple testing by taking two slightly different designs (A/B testing) and comparing how well they perform against each other under different variables. Restaurants can then take whatever design performs the best out of those two, and use it in their digital campaign to get a better return on investment. With traditional signage, there's not a precise way to test out a campaign like this because it's difficult to correlate an increase in sales with a sign or menu without knowing which variable caused it. These apps provide the software to do so. One of the best parts about electronic menu boards is the ability that companies have to promote their brand from within. There are ample opportunities to display company logos or advertisements, or messaging that is not available on an old-fashioned menu. While restaurants can promote their brand, they can also make sure that it stays consistent amongst their other multiple chains. There's also always an inherent risk with old-fashioned signage that employees forget to change an item on the board. Electronic menu boards prevent that from happening because restaurants can make sure all of their franchise locations are consistent, no matter where they are. Though many restaurants are weary to switch from traditional menus to digital menu boards, the opportunities that they provide for sales growth and consumer happiness cannot be understated. The modern trend is towards digitization, and all larger restaurants are moving towards changing their menus to be more innovative and creative through the utilization of digital menus. Consumers will provide a return on investment by taking advantage of the new call to actions that are utilized, and will be drawn in by the impressionable visual effects on the restaurant menu. The path of the future is digitization, and restaurants need to be on board.

page_content = 7 Reasons Why You Need an Electronic Menu Board Example of an electronic menu board Electronic menu boards provide ample opportunities for restaurants to improve sales and draw in consumers through impressionable visuals, board templates, dinner menus, and brand optimization. 1. Simpler to Change and Update Electronic menu board - outside of a restaurant 2. More Impressionable 3. Creates a Call to Action Electronic menu board - Manager answering phone 4. Sales Data Can Be Evaluated More Efficiently 5. Menu Apps That Work for You 6. ROI Electronic menu board - Patrons eating out at a restaurant 7. Brand Consistency Don't Miss Out on Electronic Menu Boards Electronic menu board - Man looking at menu The current population is obsessed with easy use and easy read digital media. Whether it be televisions, smartphones, digital signage, iPads, or social media, the nation is full of potential consumers who want to receive their information through digitized means. Companies are drastically updating and reworking their own advertisements and signage in order to keep up with this trend. Furthermore, they need their messaging to be more progressive and innovative than the competition. Just like any other industry, restaurants have instinctively moved towards incorporating digital trends into their advertisements and signage. An electronic menu board, or menus controlled digitally, are one of the recent courses of action that restaurants have taken to move in this direction. Here's some benefits of using an electronic menu board and signage software. Old-fashioned signage displays often takes longer to update because it is sometimes handwritten, and includes decorations that are finished individually, instead of by a computer. Sometimes smaller restaurants use chalkboards with tedious calligraphy and hand-drawn artwork. Though owners may think this gives their restaurant a unique flair, this type of work also takes up quality time and resources. Luckily, electronic menu boards can be updated quickly on a user-friendly app, at any time, and at any location. Global restaurants or fast food chains that change their menu board templates on a regular basis will find it to be much easier to move towards digitization, as they have many more locations, franchises, and updates every day. Regular digital signage displays aren't going to usually have the wow factor that draws consumers in to buy a sandwich. Colors aren't as vibrant as they are on a digital menu board solution, nor are their promotional campaigns as big, so there's less engagement from consumers and doesn't provide the same type of customer experience. Electronic menu boards incorporate more high-quality visuals, such as vibrant coloring, detailed pictures and engaging videos about breakfast, lunch, dinner. If there's a particular item that is the special of the day or a special that the company is promoting, an electronic menu board can highlight this featured item by showcasing its picture in more visible locations of the establishment. In other words, companies can use digital signage software to create the impressions they want, when they want, and where they want on their electronic menu board. Because of the potent visual effects that digitization imparts, electronic menu boards provide opportunities for restaurants to draw consumers in towards performing a specific action. This includes buying that special of the day, or signing up for a new reward program. On a side note, providing this quick service also help build up a restaurant's social media following and creates interest in the company website. Making that information more visual to the consumer entices them to follow the restaurant online, especially if there's a monetary incentive to do so. For example, a restaurant can offer specials on electronic menu boards that are only available if someone signs up via email. Or they can incentivize consumers to re-share a picture of themselves at the restaurant on Instagram, in order to qualify for a buy 1-get 1 promotion. With traditional non web-based signage, it takes much longer to evaluate and correlate sales data because there aren't the same opportunities to create calls to action and make products more impressionable to consumers. Electronic menu boards offer ample opportunities for companies to incorporate calls to action and decrease perceived wait times, so a digital sales campaign can evaluate this data on a day-by-day basis. Restaurants can use their menu board solution to look at what consumers are buying every day, and modify their business to better fulfill the needs of the consumer. This means staying fully stocked on popular items, knowing when to replenish ingredients, and removing menu options that aren't meeting expectations. Managers can change their menu items or nutritional information from anywhere, from any location simply by using digital menu apps on their smartphones or tablets that allow for quick fixes and updates on promotions. This provides opportunities for larger restaurant chains to easily outsource updates to the managerial staff at specific franchises. It also saves the need for any artistic skills, because the app already has a qualified team curating an optimized design on a new menu that exemplifies the restaurant's unique brand. Electronic menu boards improve sales dramatically by creating more calls to action through visual effects, so restaurants will see the money spent on electronic menu boards come back, ten-fold. Restaurants can also easily experiment with design promotions by utilizing software within their app that work with digital campaigns to see how well they are performing. These software tools can do simple testing by taking two slightly different designs (A/B testing) and comparing how well they perform against each other under different variables. Restaurants can then take whatever design performs the best out of those two, and use it in their digital campaign to get a better return on investment. With traditional signage, there's not a precise way to test out a campaign like this because it's difficult to correlate an increase in sales with a sign or menu without knowing which variable caused it. These apps provide the software to do so. One of the best parts about electronic menu boards is the ability that companies have to promote their brand from within. There are ample opportunities to display company logos or advertisements, or messaging that is not available on an old-fashioned menu. While restaurants can promote their brand, they can also make sure that it stays consistent amongst their other multiple chains. There's also always an inherent risk with old-fashioned signage that employees forget to change an item on the board. Electronic menu boards prevent that from happening because restaurants can make sure all of their franchise locations are consistent, no matter where they are. Though many restaurants are weary to switch from traditional menus to digital menu boards, the opportunities that they provide for sales growth and consumer happiness cannot be understated. The modern trend is towards digitization, and all larger restaurants are moving towards changing their menus to be more innovative and creative through the utilization of digital menus. Consumers will provide a return on investment by taking advantage of the new call to actions that are utilized, and will be drawn in by the impressionable visual effects on the restaurant menu. The path of the future is digitization, and restaurants need to be on board.

page_content = 7 Reasons Why You Need an Electronic Menu Board Example of an electronic menu board Electronic menu boards provide ample opportunities for restaurants to improve sales and draw in consumers through impressionable visuals, board templates, dinner menus, and brand optimization. 1. Simpler to Change and Update Electronic menu board - outside of a restaurant 2. More Impressionable 3. Creates a Call to Action Electronic menu board - Manager answering phone 4. Sales Data Can Be Evaluated More Efficiently 5. Menu Apps That Work for You 6. ROI Electronic menu board - Patrons eating out at a restaurant 7. Brand Consistency Don't Miss Out on Electronic Menu Boards Electronic menu board - Man looking at menu The current population is obsessed with easy use and easy read digital media. Whether it be televisions, smartphones, digital signage, iPads, or social media, the nation is full of potential consumers who want to receive their information through digitized means. Companies are drastically updating and reworking their own advertisements and signage in order to keep up with this trend. Furthermore, they need their messaging to be more progressive and innovative than the competition. Just like any other industry, restaurants have instinctively moved towards incorporating digital trends into their advertisements and signage. An electronic menu board, or menus controlled digitally, are one of the recent courses of action that restaurants have taken to move in this direction. Here's some benefits of using an electronic menu board and signage software. Old-fashioned signage displays often takes longer to update because it is sometimes handwritten, and includes decorations that are finished individually, instead of by a computer. Sometimes smaller restaurants use chalkboards with tedious calligraphy and hand-drawn artwork. Though owners may think this gives their restaurant a unique flair, this type of work also takes up quality time and resources. Luckily, electronic menu boards can be updated quickly on a user-friendly app, at any time, and at any location. Global restaurants or fast food chains that change their menu board templates on a regular basis will find it to be much easier to move towards digitization, as they have many more locations, franchises, and updates every day. Regular digital signage displays aren't going to usually have the wow factor that draws consumers in to buy a sandwich. Colors aren't as vibrant as they are on a digital menu board solution, nor are their promotional campaigns as big, so there's less engagement from consumers and doesn't provide the same type of customer experience. Electronic menu boards incorporate more high-quality visuals, such as vibrant coloring, detailed pictures and engaging videos about breakfast, lunch, dinner. If there's a particular item that is the special of the day or a special that the company is promoting, an electronic menu board can highlight this featured item by showcasing its picture in more visible locations of the establishment. In other words, companies can use digital signage software to create the impressions they want, when they want, and where they want on their electronic menu board. Because of the potent visual effects that digitization imparts, electronic menu boards provide opportunities for restaurants to draw consumers in towards performing a specific action. This includes buying that special of the day, or signing up for a new reward program. On a side note, providing this quick service also help build up a restaurant's social media following and creates interest in the company website. Making that information more visual to the consumer entices them to follow the restaurant online, especially if there's a monetary incentive to do so. For example, a restaurant can offer specials on electronic menu boards that are only available if someone signs up via email. Or they can incentivize consumers to re-share a picture of themselves at the restaurant on Instagram, in order to qualify for a buy 1-get 1 promotion. With traditional non web-based signage, it takes much longer to evaluate and correlate sales data because there aren't the same opportunities to create calls to action and make products more impressionable to consumers. Electronic menu boards offer ample opportunities for companies to incorporate calls to action and decrease perceived wait times, so a digital sales campaign can evaluate this data on a day-by-day basis. Restaurants can use their menu board solution and technical support to look at what consumers are buying every day, and modify their business to better fulfill the needs of the consumer. This implies staying fully stocked on popular items, knowing when to replenish ingredients, and removing menu options that aren't meeting expectations. Managers can change their menu items or nutritional information from anywhere, from any location simply by using digital menu apps on their smartphones or tablets that allow for quick fixes and updates on promotions. This provides opportunities for larger restaurant chains to easily outsource updates to the managerial staff at specific franchises. It also saves the need for any artistic skills, because the app already has a qualified team curating an optimized design on a new menu that exemplifies the restaurant's unique brand. Electronic menu boards improve sales dramatically by creating more calls to action through visual effects, so restaurants will see the money spent on electronic menu boards come back, ten-fold. Restaurants can also easily experiment with design promotions by utilizing software within their app that work with digital campaigns to see how well they are performing. These software tools can do simple testing by taking two slightly different designs (A/B testing) and comparing how well they perform against each other under different variables. Restaurants can then take whatever design performs the best out of those two, and use it in their digital campaign to get a better return on investment. With traditional signage, there's not a precise way to test out a campaign like this because it's difficult to correlate an increase in sales with a sign or menu without knowing which variable caused it. These apps provide the software to do so. One of the best parts about electronic menu boards is the ability that companies have to promote their brand from within. There are ample opportunities to display company logos or advertisements, or messaging that is not available on an old-fashioned menu. While restaurants can promote their brand, they can also make sure that it stays consistent amongst their other multiple chains. There's also always an inherent risk with old-fashioned signage that employees forget to change an item on the board. Electronic menu boards prevent that from happening because restaurants can make sure all of their franchise locations are consistent, no matter where they are. Though many restaurants are weary to switch from traditional menus to digital menu boards, the opportunities that they provide for sales growth and consumer happiness cannot be understated. The modern trend is towards digitization, and all larger restaurants are moving towards changing their menus to be more innovative and creative through the utilization of digital menus. Consumers will provide a return on investment by taking advantage of the new call to actions that are utilized, and will be drawn in by the impressionable visual effects on the restaurant menu. The path of the future is digitization, and restaurants need to be on board.

page_content = 7 Reasons Why You Need an Electronic Menu Board Example of an electronic menu board Electronic menu boards provide ample opportunities for restaurants to improve sales and draw in consumers through impressionable visuals, board templates, dinner menus, and brand optimization. 1. Simpler to Change and Update Electronic menu board - outside of a restaurant 2. More Impressionable 3. Creates a Call to Action Electronic menu board - Manager answering phone 4. Sales Data Can Be Evaluated More Efficiently 5. Menu Apps That Work for You 6. ROI Electronic menu board - Patrons eating out at a restaurant 7. Brand Consistency Don't Miss Out on Electronic Menu Boards Electronic menu board - Man looking at menu The current population is obsessed with easy use and easy read digital media. Whether it be televisions, smartphones, digital signage, iPads, or social media, the nation is full of potential consumers who want to receive their information through digitized means. Companies are drastically updating and reworking their own advertisements and signage in order to keep up with this trend. Furthermore, they need their messaging to be more progressive and innovative than the competition. Just like any other industry, restaurants have instinctively moved towards incorporating digital trends into their advertisements and signage. An electronic menu board, or menus controlled digitally, are one of the recent courses of action that restaurants have taken to move in this direction. Here's some benefits of using an electronic menu board and signage software. Old-fashioned signage displays often takes longer to update because it is sometimes handwritten, and includes decorations that are finished individually, instead of by a computer. Sometimes smaller restaurants use chalkboards with tedious calligraphy and hand-drawn artwork. Though owners may think this gives their restaurant a unique flair, this type of work also takes up quality time and resources. Luckily, electronic menu boards can be updated quickly on a user-friendly app, at any time, and at any location. Global restaurants or fast food chains that change their menu board templates on a regular basis will find it to be much easier to move towards digitization, as they have many more locations, franchises, and updates every day. Regular digital signage displays aren't going to usually have the wow factor that draws consumers in to buy a sandwich. Colors aren't as vibrant as they are on a digital menu board solution, nor are their promotional campaigns as big, so there's less engagement from consumers and doesn't provide the same type of customer experience. Electronic menu boards incorporate more high-quality visuals, such as vibrant coloring, detailed pictures and engaging videos about breakfast, lunch, dinner. If there's a particular item that is the special of the day or a special that the company is promoting, an electronic menu board can highlight this featured item by showcasing its picture in more visible locations of the establishment. In other words, companies can use digital signage software to create the impressions they want, when they want, and where they want on their electronic menu board. Because of the potent visual effects that digitization imparts, electronic menu boards provide opportunities for restaurants to draw consumers in towards performing a specific action. This includes buying that special of the day at the point sale, or signing up for a new reward program. On a side note, providing this quick service also help build up a restaurant's social media following and creates interest in the company website. Making that information more visual to the consumer entices them to follow the restaurant online, especially if there's a monetary incentive to do so. For example, a restaurant can offer specials on electronic menu boards that are only available if someone signs up via email. Or they can incentivize consumers to re-share a picture of themselves at the restaurant on Instagram, in order to qualify for a buy 1-get 1 promotion. With traditional non web-based signage, it takes much longer to evaluate and correlate sales data because there aren't the same opportunities to create calls to action and make products more impressionable to consumers. Electronic menu boards offer ample opportunities for companies to incorporate calls to action and decrease perceived wait times, so a digital sales campaign can evaluate this data on a day-by-day basis. Restaurants can use their menu board solution and technical support to look at what consumers are buying every day, and modify their business to better fulfill the needs of the consumer. This implies staying fully stocked on popular items, knowing when to replenish ingredients, and removing menu options that aren't meeting expectations. Managers can change their menu items or nutritional information from anywhere, from any location simply by using digital menu apps on their smartphones or tablets that allow for quick fixes and updates on promotions. This provides opportunities for larger restaurant chains to easily outsource updates to the managerial staff at specific franchises. It also saves the need for any artistic skills, because the app already has a qualified team curating an optimized design on a new menu that exemplifies the restaurant's unique brand. Electronic menu boards improve sales dramatically by creating more calls to action through visual effects, so restaurants will see the money spent on electronic menu boards come back, ten-fold. Restaurants can also easily experiment with design promotions by utilizing software within their app that work with digital campaigns to see how well they are performing. These software tools can do simple testing by taking two slightly different designs (A/B testing) and comparing how well they perform against each other under different variables. Restaurants can then take whatever design performs the best out of those two, and use it in their digital campaign to get a better return on investment. With traditional signage, there's not a precise way to test out a campaign like this because it's difficult to correlate an increase in sales with a sign or menu without knowing which variable caused it. These apps provide the software to do so. One of the best parts about electronic menu boards is the ability that companies have to promote their brand from within. There are ample opportunities to display company logos or advertisements, or messaging that is not available on an old-fashioned menu. While restaurants can promote their brand, they can also make sure that it stays consistent amongst their other multiple chains. There's also always an inherent risk with old-fashioned signage that employees forget to change an item on the board. Electronic menu boards prevent that from happening because restaurants can make sure all of their franchise locations are consistent, no matter where they are. Though many restaurants are weary to switch from traditional menus to digital menu boards, the opportunities that they provide for sales growth and consumer happiness cannot be understated. The modern trend is towards digitization, and all larger restaurants are moving towards changing their menus to be more innovative and creative through the utilization of digital menus. Consumers will provide a return on investment by taking advantage of the new call to actions that are utilized, and will be drawn in by the impressionable visual effects on the restaurant menu. The path of the future is digitization, and restaurants need to be on board.

page_content = Accounts Payable and Receivable – What’s the Difference? Accounts payable and receivable maintain the company’s cash flow by monitoring funds entering and leaving the business to ensure all accounts are balanced. What are Accounts Payable? What are Accounts Receivable? How to Create Accounts Payable Types of Accounts Receivable Notes Receivable Trades Receivable Bad Accounts Businesses are responsible for paying their financial obligations while simultaneously keeping in touch with clients that still have pending debts. Although this may seem overwhelming for one accounting department, many companies divide these tasks into two segments. Accounts payable and receivable handle money flowing in and out of the organization, so financial advisors can accurately gauge their financial stability at all times. Accounts payable (AP) is a department that keeps track of money the business owes to external parties. Typical third parties include suppliers, banks, financial institutions, and even other companies. For retailers, AP usually consists of vendors that provide goods and services. The AP department pays their recipients on different terms, depending on the individual payment agreement. While some contracts require the total to be paid in full, others may accept incremental compensation. There are three key steps to AP payment processing- 1. Receive the Invoice- Once the business obtains the loan, goods, or other services, they should receive an invoice from the supplier requesting the payment. 2. File the Invoice- Next, AP employees must file the invoice in their organizational system, whether it is a physical filing cabinet or software. 3. Approve the Invoice- Before the invoice is paid, it must be verified and approved. Typically, there are one or two executives that have the power to complete the approval process. 4. Process the Payment- After the invoice is approved, AP can process the payment and contact the recipient. Accounts receivable (AR) is essentially the opposite of AP, meaning that this department keeps track of the business’s current assets. In other words, AR monitors how much money each client owes the company. These parties may also consist of banks and other companies. The AR department is responsible for keeping in touch with clients and collecting their payments. Much like the AP process, AR runs off of a strict system- 1. Create an Invoice- Once the business fulfills the customer’s order, they can create an invoice reflecting the order and payment agreement. 2. Send the Invoice- After double-checking the invoice for accuracy, it can be sent to the recipient. 3. Track the Invoice- Sometimes, clients do not respond to invoices promptly, requiring AR to check in regularly until the amount is paid. 4. Collect the Payment- When the payment is received, AR will record the amount and update the system to reflect the fulfillment. In the books, AP is recorded as a current liability, as it represents outgoing funds. This makes keeping an AP ledger and audit trail critical for maintaining financial stability. The books should record each invoice and detail the- Biller’s name Account number Invoice number Expense amount Invoice receipt date Payment deadline Payment status With an audit trail, AP can monitor the status of each invoice. Therefore, the department should also file- Purchase orders Supplier invoices Contracts Payment agreements As a business grows, they begin to extend their AR department so they can offer their customers various payment options. These different segments define the relationship that the company has with each client. Notes receivable is very similar to traditional AR, except it offers flexible repayment terms and deadlines. Typically, traditional AR gives customers a two-month window to pay their bill in full before penalty fees are applied to their account. On the other hand, a notes receivable account allows clients to sign a promissory note that states they will pay off their loan, goods, or services within the allotted time. The traditional promissory note gives customers a year to pay their debt, although every business can alter this timeframe. This term can even be negotiated between the customer and business. However, this binding agreement gives the company a legal claim on the payment. Trades receivable is another asset in AR and is the direct result of the business’s sales. When a customer purchases a good or service with a limited pay-off term, their sale is reported to trades receivable as it has a quick turnaround. Even if the purchase was made on credit, trades receivable can record it as an incoming asset. Because of the short-term payoff deadline, trades receivable is typically used by retailers and organizations that offer moderately priced goods and services. Unfortunately, sometimes situations arise that make it difficult for customers to pay off their debts within their allotted time. A borrower’s inability to repay their loan is known as payment delinquency, and there are a few ways that businesses can deal with it. If it is evident that the borrower will not pay their debt, the company can write off the sum as a tax deduction. The IRS allows businesses to claim debts up to a specific limit. Another option is companies can report the debt as an allowance, enabling accountants to keep the sum for a limited time as they await the payment.

page_content = Accounts Payable and Receivable – What’s the Difference? accounts receivable accounts receivable Accounts payable and receivable maintain the company’s cash flow by monitoring funds entering and leaving the business to ensure all accounts are balanced. What are Accounts Payable? What are Accounts Receivable? How to Create Accounts Payable Types of Accounts Receivable Notes Receivable Trades Receivable Bad Accounts Businesses are responsible for paying their financial obligations while simultaneously keeping in touch with clients that still have pending debts. Although this may seem overwhelming for one accounting department, many companies divide these tasks into two segments. Accounts payable and receivable handle money flowing in and out of the organization, so financial advisors can accurately gauge their financial stability at all times. Accounts payable (AP) is a department that keeps track of money the business owes to external parties. Typical third parties include suppliers, banks, financial institutions, and even other companies. For retailers, AP usually consists of vendors that provide goods and services. The AP department pays their recipients on different terms, depending on the individual payment agreement. While some contracts require the total to be paid in full, others may accept incremental compensation. There are three key steps to AP payment processing- 1. Receive the Invoice- Once the business obtains the loan, goods, or other services, they should receive an invoice from the supplier requesting the payment. 2. File the Invoice- Next, AP employees must file the invoice in their organizational system , whether it is a physical filing cabinet or software. 3. Approve the Invoice- Before the invoice is paid, it must be verified and approved. Typically, there are one or two executives that have the power to complete the approval process. 4. Process the Payment- After the invoice is approved, AP can process the payment and contact the recipient. Accounts receivable (AR) is essentially the opposite of AP, meaning that this department keeps track of the business’s current assets. In other words, AR monitors how much money each client owes the company. These parties may also consist of banks and other companies. The AR department is responsible for keeping in touch with clients and collecting their payments. Much like the AP process, AR runs off of a strict system- 1. Create an Invoice- Once the business fulfills the customer’s order, they can create an invoice reflecting the order and payment agreement. 2. Send the Invoice- After double-checking the invoice for accuracy, it can be sent to the recipient. 3. Track the Invoice- Sometimes, clients do not respond to invoices promptly, requiring AR to check in regularly until the amount is paid. 4. Collect the Payment- When the payment is received, AR will record the amount and update the system to reflect the fulfillment. In the books, AP is recorded as a current liability, as it represents outgoing funds. This makes keeping an AP ledger and audit trail critical for maintaining financial stability. The books should record each invoice and detail the- Biller’s name Account number Invoice number Expense amount Invoice receipt date Payment deadline Payment status With an audit trail, AP can monitor the status of each invoice. Therefore, the department should also file- Purchase orders Supplier invoices Contracts Payment agreements As a business grows, they begin to extend their AR department so they can offer their customers various payment options. These different segments define the relationship that the company has with each client. Notes receivable is very similar to traditional AR, except it offers flexible repayment terms and deadlines. Typically, traditional AR gives customers a two-month window to pay their bill in full before penalty fees are applied to their account. On the other hand, a notes receivable account allows clients to sign a promissory note that states they will pay off their loan, goods, or services within the allotted time. The traditional promissory note gives customers a year to pay their debt, although every business can alter this timeframe. This term can even be negotiated between the customer and business. However, this binding agreement gives the company a legal claim on the payment. Trades receivable is another asset in AR and is the direct result of the business’s sales. When a customer purchases a good or service with a limited pay-off term, their sale is reported to trades receivable as it has a quick turnaround. Even if the purchase was made on credit, trades receivable can record it as an incoming asset. Because of the short-term payoff deadline, trades receivable is typically used by retailers and organizations that offer moderately priced goods and services. Unfortunately, sometimes situations arise that make it difficult for customers to pay off their debts within their allotted time. A borrower’s inability to repay their loan is known as payment delinquency, and there are a few ways that businesses can deal with it. If it is evident that the borrower will not pay their debt, the company can write off the sum as a tax deduction. The IRS allows businesses to claim debts up to a specific limit. Another option is companies can report the debt as an allowance, enabling accountants to keep the sum for a limited time as they await the payment.

page_content = How to Make a Strategic Communications Plan in 3 Steps stargfsadsdas A strategic communications plan is an excellent tool for increasing bottom line profitability and overall business success. 3 Steps to Developing a Strategic Communications Plan 1. Communication Remember: 2. Designation 3. Allocation Important: A strategic communications plan helps businesses make sure their marketing and communication strategy is in alignment with business goals. Additionally, a strategic communications plan supplies team members with guidance throughout the entire process. Even public relations and social media experts may struggle to develop a strategic communications plan. Thankfully there are best practices and steps to assist with communications planning efforts. 3 steps to develop a strategic communications plan include: Proper communication is crucial for achieving business goals. Unsurprisingly, communication is a major component throughout the communications planning process. Staff members must make sure that both marketing and communication plans are in alignment with high level business objectives. Additionally, the target audience should be identified during this step of the strategic communications planning process. Key messages are crucial for public relations campaign success. Key messages are defined as the core messages a business wants its target audience to understand and retain. Any communication plan that fails to deliver key messages to target audience members will not be successful. Best practices for better understanding a target audience include modeling different ways to communicate key messages and buyer persona creation. Strategic communications planning teams must make sure to gain a better understanding of both key stakeholders and target audience members. Strategic communications planning teams must make sure that both key stakeholders and target audience members are considered during communication strategy formulation. Human capital is the most invaluable asset and resources that a business possesses. During strategic communications planning initiatives it is absolutely essential that team members are qualified and experienced. A designated communications director is responsible for both leading and coordinating the entire strategic plan team. As such, the communications director must make sure they completely understand their role as well as the roles of other team members. To help team members better understand their responsibilities during the strategic communications plan a communications director may recommend case studies in addition to other research. Once an outstanding communication plan director is selected, tasks and responsibilities can be delegated. The tasks that strategic communications plan team members are assigned are largely dependent on the strategic communications plan itself. For example, while one business may have a social media campaign planned, another may supply program webinars. The strategic communications plan team must also optimize internal communication interactions. Internal communication interactions can range from strategic communication team meetings to more casual social media interactions between coworkers. Generally, a communication plan will be established for the upcoming six months. Some businesses may choose to define communication plan duties for the entire upcoming year. However, it is important to note that no matter how excellent strategic communications plan designation is, without proper resource allocation it is wasted. After the designation step is completed resource allocation must be considered. Best practices for proper resource allocation include the analysis of both strategic communications plan case studies and financial statements. Businesses must make sure they can afford their strategic communications plan before implementing it. Beginning strategic communications planning without enough resources available can be devastating to a business's bottom line. Key stakeholders will likely have a lot of input about the strategic communications plan. Communications directors should make sure to request feedback from key stakeholders and team members. It is also helpful to consider different ways that the strategic communications plan can be executed. Strategic communications planning team members often discover different ways to complete the same tasks but for much less money. For example, a business may decide to use an internal public relations or social media employee instead of hiring a third party consultant. Different techniques that strategic communications planning team members explore may even save the company on another resource: time. The communication strategy must make sure that a timeline is maintained. Not only can a timeline be utilized to provide key stakeholders with progress updates but it also encourages team member accountability. Additionally, a timeline will avoid the strategic communications plan team members from engaging in duplicative tasks accidentally. As a result of proper resource allocation, a business can save employee time and costs. The strategic communications plan director must make sure to request feedback from both key stakeholders and team members.

keyword = Accounts Payable And Receivable
page_content = Accounts Payable and Receivable – What’s the Difference? accounts receivable accounts receivable Accounts payable and receivable maintain the company’s cash flow by monitoring funds entering and leaving the business to ensure all accounts are balanced. What are Accounts Payable? accounts payable accounts payable What are Accounts Receivable? payable accounts payable How to Create Accounts Payable Types of Accounts Receivable Notes Receivable Trades Receivable Bad Accounts Businesses are responsible for paying their financial obligations while simultaneously keeping in touch with clients that still have pending debts. Although this may seem overwhelming for one accounting department, many companies divide these tasks into two segments. Accounts payable and receivable handle money flowing in and out of the organization, so financial advisors can accurately gauge their financial stability at all times. Accounts payable (AP) is a department that keeps track of money the business owes to external parties. Typical third parties include suppliers, banks, financial institutions, and even other companies. For retailers, AP usually consists of vendors that provide goods and services. The AP department pays their recipients on different terms, depending on the individual payment agreement. While some contracts require the total to be paid in full, others may accept incremental compensation. There are three key steps to AP payment processing- 1. Receive the Invoice- Once the business obtains the loan, goods, or other services, they should receive an invoice from the supplier requesting the payment. 2. File the Invoice- Next, AP employees must file the invoice in their organizational system , whether it is a physical filing cabinet or software. 3. Approve the Invoice- Before the invoice is paid, it must be verified and approved. Typically, there are one or two executives that have the power to complete the approval process. 4. Process the Payment- After the invoice is approved, AP can process the payment and contact the recipient. Accounts receivable (AR) is essentially the opposite of AP, meaning that this department keeps track of the business's current assets. In other words, AR monitors how much money each client owes the company. These parties may also consist of banks and other companies. The AR department is responsible for keeping in touch with clients and collecting their payments. Much like the AP process, AR runs off of a strict system- 1. Create an Invoice- Once the business fulfills the customer's order, they can create an invoice reflecting the order and payment agreement. 2. Send the Invoice- After double-checking the invoice for accuracy, it can be sent to the recipient. 3. Track the Invoice- Sometimes, clients do not respond to invoices promptly, requiring AR to check in regularly until the amount is paid. 4. Collect the Payment- When the payment is received, AR will record the amount and update the system to reflect the fulfillment. In the books, AP is recorded as a current liability, as it represents outgoing funds. This makes keeping an AP ledger and audit trail critical for maintaining financial stability. The books should record each invoice and detail the- Biller's name Account number Invoice number Expense amount Invoice receipt date Payment deadline Payment status With an audit trail, AP can monitor the status of each invoice. Therefore, the department should also file- Purchase orders Supplier invoices Contracts Payment agreements As a business grows, they begin to extend their AR department so they can offer their customers various payment options. These different segments define the relationship that the company has with each client.Notes receivable is very similar to traditional AR, except it offers flexible repayment terms and deadlines. Typically, traditional AR gives customers a two-month window to pay their bill in full before penalty fees are applied to their account. On the other hand, a notes receivable account allows clients to sign a promissory note that states they will pay off their loan, goods, or services within the allotted time. The traditional promissory note gives customers a year to pay their debt, although every business can alter this timeframe. This term can even be negotiated between the customer and business. However, this binding agreement gives the company a legal claim on the payment. Trades receivable is another asset in AR and is the direct result of the business's sales. When a customer purchases a good or service with a limited pay-off term, their sale is reported to trades receivable as it has a quick turnaround. Even if the purchase was made on credit, trades receivable can record it as an incoming asset. Because of the short-term payoff deadline, trades receivable is typically used by retailers and organizations that offer moderately priced goods and services.Unfortunately, sometimes situations arise that make it difficult for customers to pay off their debts within their allotted time. A borrower's inability to repay their loan is known as payment delinquency, and there are a few ways that businesses can deal with it. If it is evident that the borrower will not pay their debt, the company can write off the sum as a tax deduction. The IRS allows businesses to claim debts up to a specific limit. Another option is companies can report the debt as an allowance, enabling accountants to keep the sum for a limited time as they await the payment.

keyword = Accounts Payable And Receivable
page_content = Accounts Payable and Receivable – What’s the Difference? accounts receivable accounts receivable Accounts payable and receivable maintain the company’s cash flow by monitoring funds entering and leaving the business to ensure all accounts are balanced. What are Accounts Payable? accounts payable accounts payable What are Accounts Receivable? payable accounts payable How to Create Accounts Payable difference accounts payable accounts Types of Accounts Receivable accounts receivable money Notes Receivable Trades Receivable Bad Accounts Businesses are responsible for paying their financial obligations while simultaneously keeping in touch with clients that still have pending debts. Although this may seem overwhelming for one accounting department, many companies divide these tasks into two segments. Accounts payable and receivable handle money flowing in and out of the organization, so financial advisors can accurately gauge their financial stability at all times. Accounts payable (AP) is a department that keeps track of money the business owes to external parties. Typical third parties include suppliers, banks, financial institutions, and even other companies. For retailers, AP usually consists of vendors that provide goods and services. The AP department pays their recipients on different terms, depending on the individual payment agreement. While some contracts require the total to be paid in full, others may accept incremental compensation. There are three key steps to AP payment processing- 1. Receive the Invoice- Once the business obtains the loan, goods, or other services, they should receive an invoice from the supplier requesting the payment. 2. File the Invoice- Next, AP employees must file the invoice in their organizational system , whether it is a physical filing cabinet or software. 3. Approve the Invoice- Before the invoice is paid, it must be verified and approved. Typically, there are one or two executives that have the power to complete the approval process. 4. Process the Payment- After the invoice is approved, AP can process the payment and contact the recipient. Accounts receivable (AR) is essentially the opposite of AP, meaning that this department keeps track of the business's current assets. In other words, AR monitors how much money each client owes the company. These parties may also consist of banks and other companies. The AR department is responsible for keeping in touch with clients and collecting their payments. Much like the AP process, AR runs off of a strict system- 1. Create an Invoice- Once the business fulfills the customer's order, they can create an invoice reflecting the order and payment agreement. 2. Send the Invoice- After double-checking the invoice for accuracy, it can be sent to the recipient. 3. Track the Invoice- Sometimes, clients do not respond to invoices promptly, requiring AR to check in regularly until the amount is paid. 4. Collect the Payment- When the payment is received, AR will record the amount and update the system to reflect the fulfillment. In the books, AP is recorded as a current liability, as it represents outgoing funds. This makes keeping an AP ledger and audit trail critical for maintaining financial stability. The books should record each invoice and detail the- Biller's name Account number Invoice number Expense amount Invoice receipt date Payment deadline Payment status With an audit trail, AP can monitor the status of each invoice. Therefore, the department should also file- Purchase orders Supplier invoices Contracts Payment agreements As a business grows, they begin to extend their AR department so they can offer their customers various payment options. These different segments define the relationship that the company has with each client.Notes receivable is very similar to traditional AR, except it offers flexible repayment terms and deadlines. Typically, traditional AR gives customers a two-month window to pay their bill in full before penalty fees are applied to their account. On the other hand, a notes receivable account allows clients to sign a promissory note that states they will pay off their loan, goods, or services within the allotted time. The traditional promissory note gives customers a year to pay their debt, although every business can alter this timeframe. This term can even be negotiated between the customer and business. However, this binding agreement gives the company a legal claim on the payment. Trades receivable is another asset in AR and is the direct result of the business's sales. When a customer purchases a good or service with a limited pay-off term, their sale is reported to trades receivable as it has a quick turnaround. Even if the purchase was made on credit, trades receivable can record it as an incoming asset. Because of the short-term payoff deadline, trades receivable is typically used by retailers and organizations that offer moderately priced goods and services.Unfortunately, sometimes situations arise that make it difficult for customers to pay off their debts within their allotted time. A borrower's inability to repay their loan is known as payment delinquency, and there are a few ways that businesses can deal with it. If it is evident that the borrower will not pay their debt, the company can write off the sum as a tax deduction. The IRS allows businesses to claim debts up to a specific limit. Another option is companies can report the debt as an allowance, enabling accountants to keep the sum for a limited time as they await the payment.

keyword = Accounts Payable And Receivable
page_content = Accounts Payable and Receivable – What’s the Difference? accounts receivable accounts receivable Accounts payable and receivable maintain the company’s cash flow by monitoring funds entering and leaving the business to ensure all accounts are balanced. What are Accounts Payable? accounts payable accounts payable What are Accounts Receivable? payable accounts payable How to Create Accounts Payable difference accounts payable accounts Types of Accounts Receivable accounts receivable money Notes Receivable Trades Receivable Bad Accounts accounting bookkeeping Businesses are responsible for paying their financial obligations while simultaneously keeping in touch with clients that still have pending debts. Although this may seem overwhelming for one accounting department, many companies divide these tasks into two segments. Accounts payable and receivable handle money flowing in and out of the organization, so financial advisors can accurately gauge their financial stability at all times. Accounts payable (AP) is a department that keeps track of money the business owes to external parties. Typical third parties include suppliers, banks, financial institutions, and even other companies. For retailers, AP usually consists of vendors that provide goods and services. The AP department pays their recipients on different terms, depending on the individual payment agreement. While some contracts require the total to be paid in full, others may accept incremental compensation. There are three key steps to AP payment processing- 1. Receive the Invoice- Once the business obtains the loan, goods, or other services, they should receive an invoice from the supplier requesting the payment. 2. File the Invoice- Next, AP employees must file the invoice in their organizational system , whether it is a physical filing cabinet or software. 3. Approve the Invoice- Before the invoice is paid, it must be verified and approved. Typically, there are one or two executives that have the power to complete the approval process. 4. Process the Payment- After the invoice is approved, AP can process the payment and contact the recipient. Accounts receivable (AR) is essentially the opposite of AP, meaning that this department keeps track of the business's current assets. In other words, AR monitors how much money each client owes the company. These parties may also consist of banks and other companies. The AR department is responsible for keeping in touch with clients and collecting their payments. Much like the AP process, AR runs off of a strict system- 1. Create an Invoice- Once the business fulfills the customer's order, they can create an invoice reflecting the order and payment agreement. 2. Send the Invoice- After double-checking the invoice for accuracy, it can be sent to the recipient. 3. Track the Invoice- Sometimes, clients do not respond to invoices promptly, requiring AR to check in regularly until the amount is paid. 4. Collect the Payment- When the payment is received, AR will record the amount and update the system to reflect the fulfillment. In the books, AP is recorded as a current liability, as it represents outgoing funds. This makes keeping an AP ledger and audit trail critical for maintaining financial stability. The books should record each invoice and detail the- Biller's name Account number Invoice number Expense amount Invoice receipt date Payment deadline Payment status With an audit trail, AP can monitor the status of each invoice. Therefore, the department should also file- Purchase orders Supplier invoices Contracts Payment agreements As a business grows, they begin to extend their AR department so they can offer their customers various payment options. These different segments define the relationship that the company has with each client.Notes receivable is very similar to traditional AR, except it offers flexible repayment terms and deadlines. Typically, traditional AR gives customers a two-month window to pay their bill in full before penalty fees are applied to their account. On the other hand, a notes receivable account allows clients to sign a promissory note that states they will pay off their loan, goods, or services within the allotted time. The traditional promissory note gives customers a year to pay their debt, although every business can alter this timeframe. This term can even be negotiated between the customer and business. However, this binding agreement gives the company a legal claim on the payment. Trades receivable is another asset in AR and is the direct result of the business's sales. When a customer purchases a good or service with a limited pay-off term, their sale is reported to trades receivable as it has a quick turnaround. Even if the purchase was made on credit, trades receivable can record it as an incoming asset. Because of the short-term payoff deadline, trades receivable is typically used by retailers and organizations that offer moderately priced goods and services.Unfortunately, sometimes situations arise that make it difficult for customers to pay off their debts within their allotted time. A borrower's inability to repay their loan is known as payment delinquency, and there are a few ways that businesses can deal with it. If it is evident that the borrower will not pay their debt, the company can write off the sum as a tax deduction. The IRS allows businesses to claim debts up to a specific limit. Another option is companies can report the debt as an allowance, enabling accountants to keep the sum for a limited time as they await the payment.

Understanding organizations’ strategic plan by all who are involved in the execution is as important as optimally creating it. A well-orchestrated process must be in place to facilitate better understanding of the strategy and the specific roles to be played by different teams. Unless the goals are understood clearly, chances are that you end up having a big gap between intended strategy and the realized strategy. So, how do we ensure that you have the right plan and process in place for a successful communication of strategy? It is a well-known fact that majority of strategies fail, a key contributor being poorly designed and executed communication plan. One should be committing adequate resources and time to develop a sound method to overcome this. Develop your communication strategy. Developing a solid communication strategy is not easy, you improve as you learn more from the feedback you get on how well the target groups received and understood the message, as it was intended. This is a continual process and there is no such thing as achieving 100% perfection. Ensure that this two-way process is effectively managed. 1. Communication Strategic communications plan Remember: 2. Designation Strategic communications plan 3. Allocation Strategic communications plan Important: Key Takeaways Strategic communications plan A strategic communications plan helps businesses make sure their marketing and communication strategy is in alignment with business goals. Additionally, a strategic communications plan supplies team members with guidance throughout the entire process. Even public relations and social media experts may struggle to develop a strategic communications plan. Thankfully there are best practices and steps to assist with communications planning efforts. 3 steps to develop a strategic communications plan include: Proper communication is crucial for achieving business goals. Unsurprisingly, communication is a major component throughout the communications planning process. Staff members must make sure that both marketing and communication plans are in alignment with high level business objectives. Additionally, the target audience should be identified during this step of the strategic communications planning process. Key messages are crucial for public relations campaign success. Key messages are defined as the core messages a business wants its target audience to understand and retain. Any communication plan that fails to deliver key messages to target audience members will not be successful. Best practices for better understanding a target audience include modeling different ways to communicate key messages and buyer persona creation. Strategic communications planning teams must make sure to gain a better understanding of both key stakeholders and target audience members. Strategic communications planning teams must make sure that both key stakeholders and target audience members are considered during communication strategy formulation. Human capital is the most invaluable asset and resources that a business possesses. During strategic communications planning initiatives it is absolutely essential that team members are qualified and experienced. A designated communications director is responsible for both leading and coordinating the entire strategic plan team. As such, the communications director must make sure they completely understand their role as well as the roles of other team members. To help team members better understand their responsibilities during the strategic communications plan a communications director may recommend case studies in addition to other research. Once an outstanding communication plan director is selected, tasks and responsibilities can be delegated. The tasks that strategic communications plan team members are assigned are largely dependent on the strategic communications plan itself. For example, while one business may have a social media campaign planned, another may supply program webinars. The strategic communications plan team must also optimize internal communication interactions. Internal communication interactions can range from strategic communication team meetings to more casual social media interactions between coworkers. Generally, a communication plan will be established for the upcoming six months. Some businesses may choose to define communication plan duties for the entire upcoming year. However, it is important to note that no matter how excellent strategic communications plan designation is, without proper resource allocation it is wasted. After the designation step is completed resource allocation must be considered. Best practices for proper resource allocation include the analysis of both strategic communications plan case studies and financial statements. Businesses must make sure they can afford their strategic communications plan before implementing it. Beginning strategic communications planning without enough resources available can be devastating to a business's bottom line. Key stakeholders will likely have a lot of input about the strategic communications plan. Communications directors should make sure to request feedback from key stakeholders and team members. It is also helpful to consider different ways that the strategic communications plan can be executed. Strategic communications planning team members often discover different ways to complete the same tasks but for much less money. For example, a business may decide to use an internal public relations or social media employee instead of hiring a third party consultant. Different techniques that strategic communications planning team members explore may even save the company on another resource: time. The communication strategy must make sure that a timeline is maintained. Not only can a timeline be utilized to provide key stakeholders with progress updates but it also encourages team member accountability. Additionally, a timeline will avoid the strategic communications plan team members from engaging in duplicative tasks accidentally.

page_content = Employee Relationship Management: What Every HR Team Should Know Employee relationship management Proper employee relationship management influences the overall employee experience as well as business bottom line profitability. Understanding Employee Relationship Management Employee relationship management Remember: Tips to Improve Coworker Relationships Tips to Improve Employee and Manager Relationships Employee relationship management Fact: Employee relationship management is defined as the process of managing relationships within a business. Employee relationship management encompasses both relationships among employees and the relationship between employees and the overall organization. Human resource professionals play a significant role in employee relationship management. As such, HR professionals must have strong employee relationship management skills. Building strong employee relationships in the workplace benefit a large variety of business functions. Benefits of proper employee relationship management range from more successful talent management to work environment optimization. Additionally, the entire employee experience is largely impacted by employee relationship management. Impacts to the overall employee experience range from lower rates of employee turnover to increased employee engagement rates. Human resource professionals know that low employee retention levels can financially devastate a business’s bottom line. Improving employee relationship management is the best way to start creating a work environment employees want to work within. Good employee relations will increase good work performed which translates directly into increased bottom line profitability. The development and maintenance of strong employee relations can supply a business with an invaluable competitive advantage. Human resources departments should make sure to utilize best practices for improving employee relationship management. Case studies show that employees spend more time with their work family than their real family. In fact, case studies estimate 56% of an employee's time is spent with their work family. Considering this statistic, employee relationship management should be a top human resource priority. Thankfully, there are many best practices for improving employee relationship management ranging from supplying proper communication tools to creating employee experience enrichment opportunities. One best way to improve employee relationships in the workplace is to increase opportunities for team members to interact. Building cross function teams allow different departments to work together towards a common objective. Employees often form incorrect assumptions about another team member or department. However, when given the opportunity to work together, employees often remember that everyone is on the same team. Best practices for improving workplace relationships between employees often include team building activities. Team building activities develop trust between team members and enhance useful workplace skills including decision making and problem solving capabilities. It is essential that human resource departments supply the proper communication tools for staff members. Especially for team members working remotely or from different office locations, communication tools should be both accessible and easy to use. Cloud based platforms and software that incorporates social media like features are communication tool examples that employees want to use. When employees feel excited to use communication tools everyone benefits. Less formal social interactions are another common technique that an HR employee may utilize to improve employee relationship management. Many HR professionals agree that the best way to do this is by providing complimentary food to team members and encourage employees to socialize while eating. Team lunches and potlucks are two examples of more informal social interactions that human resource professionals can prepare. These informal gatherings are a great opportunity for team members to build strong employee bonds and get to know each other better. A less formal atmosphere can encourage among employees non work related social interactions. Instead of focusing on a job to be done, employees often find themselves discussing more personal information like their favorite hobbies or television shows they are watching. More personal information may be shared that could even result in building strong life long friendships. As a result, employees often find themselves looking forward to these events due to how relaxed and welcoming they are. Every manager can attest to the fact that it is much easier to manage employees with whom they share a healthy relationship. Thankfully, there are many best practices for improving employee and manager relationships. Consistent one on one meetings is often considered the best way to create and maintain a strong employee and manager relationship. When managers want employees to share their feedback and encourage employees genuinely the relationship will likely strengthen. Managers should make sure that one on one meetings also incorporate more than performance management and career development conversations. Facilitating more personalized check ins where managers encourage employees to be open will help make sure employees feel valued. Another way to improve employee relationships with management is through HR professionals administering surveys. Employee engagement surveys and pulse surveys are both great options for human resource professionals to consider. Employee surveys are one best way to identify approaches to better employee experience and decrease employee turnover rates. However, for surveys to be effective they must also translate into real action by human resources professionals and management. The relationship management professionals have with their employees influences everything from the work environment to employee retention levels. Case studies show that employee engagement and job satisfaction levels are positively influenced by improved employee relationship management.

Employee relationship management encompasses both relationships among employees and the relationship between employees and the overall organization. Human resource professionals play a significant role in employee relationship management. As such, HR professionals must have strong employee relationship management skills. Building strong employee relationships in the workplace benefit a large variety of business functions. Benefits of proper employee relationship management range from more successful talent management to work environment optimization. Additionally, the entire employee experience is largely impacted by employee relationship management. Impacts to the overall employee experience range from lower rates of employee turnover to increased employee engagement rates. Human resource professionals know that low employee retention levels can financially devastate a business's bottom line. Improving employee relationship management is the best way to start creating a work environment employees want to work within. Good employee relations will increase good work performed which translates directly into increased bottom line profitability. The development and maintenance of strong employee relations can supply a business with an invaluable competitive advantage. Human resources departments should make sure to utilize best practices for improving employee relationship management. Case studies show that employees spend more time with their work family than their real family. In fact, case studies estimate 56% of an employee's time is spent with their work family. Considering this statistic, employee relationship management should be a top human resource priority. Thankfully, there are many best practices for improving employee relationship management ranging from supplying proper communication tools to creating employee experience enrichment opportunities. One best way to improve employee relationships in the workplace is to increase opportunities for team members to interact. Building cross function teams allow different departments to work together towards a common objective. Employees often form incorrect assumptions about another team member or department. However, when given the opportunity to work together, employees often remember that everyone is on the same team. Best practices for improving workplace relationships between employees often include team building activities. Team building activities develop trust between team members and enhance useful workplace skills including decision making and problem solving capabilities. It is essential that human resource departments supply the proper communication tools for staff members. Especially for team members working remotely or from different office locations, communication tools should be both accessible and easy to use. Cloud based platforms and software that incorporates social media like features are communication tool examples that employees want to use. When employees feel excited to use communication tools everyone benefits. Less formal social interactions are another common technique that an HR employee may utilize to improve employee relationship management. Many HR professionals agree that the best way to do this is by providing complimentary food to team members and encourage employees to socialize while eating. Team lunches and potlucks are two examples of more informal social interactions that human resource professionals can prepare. These informal gatherings are a great opportunity for team members to build strong employee bonds and get to know each other better. A less formal atmosphere can encourage among employees non work related social interactions. Instead of focusing on a job to be done, employees often find themselves discussing more personal information like their favorite hobbies or television shows they are watching. More personal information may be shared that could even result in building strong life long friendships. As a result, employees often find themselves looking forward to these events due to how relaxed and welcoming they are.Every manager can attest to the fact that it is much easier to manage employees with whom they share a healthy relationship. Thankfully, there are many best practices for improving employee and manager relationships. Consistent one on one meetings is often considered the best way to create and maintain a strong employee and manager relationship. When managers want employees to share their feedback and encourage employees genuinely the relationship will likely strengthen. Managers should make sure that one on one meetings also incorporate more than performance management and career development conversations. Facilitating more personalized check ins where managers encourage employees to be open will help make sure employees feel valued. Another way to improve employee relationships with management is through HR professionals administering surveys. Employee engagement surveys and pulse surveys are both great options for human resource professionals to consider. Employee surveys are one best way to identify approaches to better employee experience and decrease employee turnover rates. However, for surveys to be effective they must also translate into real action by human resources professionals and management. The relationship management professionals have with their employees influences everything from the work environment to employee retention levels. Case studies show that employee engagement and job satisfaction levels are positively influenced by improved employee relationship management. Businesses can help employees enjoy coming into work more by providing excellent employee relationship management. Tips for improving employee relationship management range from team building activities between co workers to managers that engage employees through consistent one on one meetings.
